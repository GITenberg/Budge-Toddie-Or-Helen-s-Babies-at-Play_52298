<h2 id="Illustration_DEDICATION">DEDICATION</h2>

<p>The Author of “Helen’s Babies”
dedicated that book “To the
Parents of the Best Children
in the World”; and
his commercial hint
appended thereunto
was so generally
taken, that he is impelled
by selfishness to
seek even a larger class
to which to inscribe the
present volume.
He therefore dedicates
it to</p>

<p><b>Those Who Know
How to Manage
Other People’s
Children</b>.</p>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>


<p>The many indulgent men and women who
liked “Helen’s Babies” so well that they
wished they had written it themselves would
have changed their minds could they have
been compelled to read criticisms of a certain
kind that were inflicted upon the author as
soon as his name and mail address became
known. Some people were in such haste to
relieve their minds that they rushed into
print with their charges and specifications,
all of which were of service to the book, as so
much free advertising; at least, the publisher
said it was, and his opinion on such a matter
was entitled to special respect.</p>

<p>Some of the critics were parents of the
earnest, forceful, but matter-of-fact kind that
does not doubt its own infallibility in family
government and regards all children as scions
of one unchanging stock and needing to be
treated exactly alike, no matter in what direction
their tendencies may be. A larger
number were unmarried persons with theories
of their own which had not been marred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
in whole or in part by anything so utterly
commonplace and exasperating as experience.
These good people, whether uncles or
aunts of children over whom they were not
allowed to exercise any authority, or mere
bachelors and maids unattached to anybody’
babies of any kind, joined in abusing Budge
and Toddie as the worst trained children that
ever were tossed into print and in declaring
the boys’s Uncle Harry incomparably incapable
as a disciplinarian, unless, indeed, the
parents of Budge and Toddie were still less
competent to bring up children in the way
they should go.</p>

<p>Still another class was composed of professional
teachers who had taken long, serious
courses of instruction in juvenile humanity,
its nature, possibilities, limitations, duties
and mental conditions at specified ages.
Apparently these regarded a child as something
created for the special purpose of being
subjected to personal, exact and continuous
domination by adults, and to be let alone
only when the adults themselves wearied of
the strain. To prove the unfitness of the
boys’s uncle and their parents to have the
care of children they quoted fluently from
standard authorities on education, all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
way from Aristotle, concerning whose children
history is silent, to Froebel, the founder
of the kindergarten system, who was childless.</p>

<p>Others who joined in the effort to analyze
this literary butterfly with a mallet were of
the class that could not understand why the
misdeeds and shortcomings of Budge and
Toddie were not treated with reproofs and
warnings deduced from certain catechisms, of
which infant depravity is a popular feature.
And there were the people that never read
a book but on compulsion. Anyone errs
greatly who believes that this class lacks intelligence,
for the world has contained many
wondrously clever people who could not read
or write; nevertheless, men and women who
seldom read anything do take any book
seriously, no matter if it deserves as little
attention as last year’s almanac. Some of
them sought out the author, after reading
“Helen’s Babies,” to tell him in good faith
what they would have done to Budge and
Toddie to correct some alleged deficiencies.</p>

<p>It was useless to assure any of these unexpected
critics that the author was not himself
the hero of his story, or that he had never
been manager of other people’s children when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
he was a bachelor, unless unwillingly and for
a few moments at a time, or that his book
was not in any sense a disclosure of the methods
he would have followed had such a responsibility
been thrust upon him, or that it
was no longer fashionable for a man to write
an amusing sketch for the purpose of covertly
inculcating a lot of moral principles, like so
many sugar-coated pills, or that for some
years he had been joint owner of some children
to whose mental and moral well-being
he had given more thought and care than to
his business interests and almost everything
else that men live for, and consequently he
might be regarded as beyond the need of
volunteer counsel and admonition.</p>

<p>The criticisms continued until the author
repented of having written the story that was
the cause of them. But one day a publisher
asked for some more&mdash;much more&mdash;about
Budge and Toddie, to be published serially,
and the inducements he offered were so
timely and convincing that regrets and critics
alike were laughed at. The stock of
available material was unlimited, for had
not many mothers reproached the author
for not having put into print the tales they
had told him of their own boys’s doings&mdash;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
tales which they knew were far funnier than
any recorded in “Helen’s Babies”&mdash;and had
not many other mothers given him capital
stories with positive orders to put them in
shape for publication and do so quickly?
Besides, he had a store of similar material in
his own mind. How to use the aggregate
mass of incident did not readily appear to his
mind’s eye, for he had been too long engaged,
professionally, in picking other men’s books
to pieces to have found time to learn how
best to put together a book of his own. He
had not a novelist’s privilege of choosing
from many meritorious models, for tales
about children, yet written principally to be
read by adults, were very few and of doubtful
quality.</p>

<p>Suddenly out of nowhere, apparently,
came the suggestion that the possible experiences
of some one, any one, of the critics who
knew exactly how other people’s children
should be managed would be a good framework
for the desired story. Naturally the
person most confident of such ability would
be the best character for the purpose, so it
should be a young, whole-hearted woman of
positive nature, who loved children dearly
but had none of her own to disarrange her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
theories. Facts have always been the most
pestilent enemies of theories, and children are
facts, sometimes stubborn facts, always startling
ones when they encounter any theory not
founded on the rock of experience.</p>

<p>So the tale was begun in haste, as well as
in glee over its probable effect on some of the
men and women who had been burdening the
author’s ears and mail-box with criticism and
counsel. Whether any of them ever read a
line of it when it appeared serially, or afterward
in book form, remains unknown; probably
it is better so, for the author was thereby
spared the meanness of exultation over men
and women quite as well-meaning as himself,
or spared the humiliation of discovering
that he had done his work so badly that they
were unconscious of what he had attempted
to do. And, really, none of them was any
wiser in his own conceit than was the author
himself before he had any children of his own
yet was sure he knew how other people’
children should be trained, admonished, controlled,
restrained, disciplined and otherwise
tormented by their parents.</p>

<p>The new book was spared a depressing experience
of its predecessor, for, instead of
being declined by almost every reputable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
publisher in the United States, it was demanded
by several before the second instalment
appeared and the number of requests
for it increased week by week as the serial
issue continued.</p>

<p>But, like almost everything else from the
same pen, “Other People’s Children” was
written so hastily and put to press so carelessly
that it abounded in repetitions and
other errors that made cultivated readers
grieve, so an opportunity to allow the book to
drop out of print was welcomed by the author.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was compelled to believe
his friends and enemies when they
insisted that “Other People’s Children” was
an abler and more amusing story than
“Helen’s Babies,” for their opinion agreed
with his own. So he has responded gladly
to the request of the present publishers that
he should give the copy a careful revision.
It is extremely unlikely that any reader of
the old edition will detect any alterations in
the new, for nothing has been added nor has
anything of consequence been taken out; yet
the author and publishers know that more
than a thousand corrections and emendations
have been made and that almost all of them
were needed.</p>

<small>OR</small><br />

HELEN’S BABIES AT PLAY</h2>


<p>The writer of a certain much-abused
book sat at breakfast one morning with
his wife, and their conversation turned, as it
had many times before, upon a brace of boys
who had made a little fun for the lovers of
trifling stories and a great deal of trouble for
their uncle. Mrs. Burton, thanks to that
womanly generosity which, like a garment,
covers the faults of men who are happily
married, was so proud of her husband that
she admired even his book; she had made
magnificent attempts to defend it at points
where it was utterly indefensible; but her
critical sense had been frequently offended
by her husband’s ignorance regarding the
management of children. On the particular
morning referred to, this critical sense was
extremely active.</p>

<p>“To know, Harry,” said Mrs. Burton,
“that you gave so little true personal attention
to Budge and Toddie, while you pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>fessed
to love them with the tenderness
peculiar to blood-relationship, is to wonder
whether some people do not really expect
children to grow as the forest trees grow,
utterly without care or training.”</p>

<p>“I spent most of my time,” Mr. Burton
replied, attacking his steak with more energy
than was called for at the breakfast-table of
a man whose business hours were easy, “I
spent most of my time in saving their parents’
property and their own lives from destruction.
When had I an opportunity to
do anything else?”</p>

<p>A smile of conscious superiority, the honesty
of which made it none the less tantalizing,
passed lightly over Mrs. Burton’s features as
she replied:</p>

<p>“All the while. You should have explained
to them the necessity for order,
cleanliness and self-restraint. Do you
imagine that their pure little hearts
would not have received it and acted upon
it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton offered a Yankee reply.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose, my dear,” said he “that
the necessity for all these virtues was never
brought to their attention? Did you never
hear the homely but significant saying, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
you may lead a horse to water, but you can’t
make him drink?”</p>

<p>With the promptness born of true intuition,
Mrs. Burton went around this verbal
obstacle instead of attempting to reduce it.</p>

<p>“You might at least have attempted to
teach them something of the inner significance
of things,” said Mrs. Burton. “Then
they would have brought a truer sense to the
contemplation of everything about them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton gazed almost worshipfully at
this noble creature whose impulses led her
irresistibly to the discernment of the motives
of action, and with becoming humility he
asked:</p>

<p>“Will you tell me how you would have
explained the inner significance of dirt, so that
those boys could have been trusted to cross
a dry road without creating for themselves
a halo which should be more visible than
luminous?”</p>

<p>“Don’t trifle about serious matters,
Harry,” said Mrs. Burton, after a hasty but
evident search for a reply. “You know that
conscience and æsthetic sense lead to correct
lives all persons who subject themselves to
their influence, and you know that the purest
natures are the most susceptible. If men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
and women, warped and mistrained though
their earlier lives may have been, grow into
sweetness and light under right incentives,
what may not be done with those of whom it
was said, ‘Of such is the kingdom of heaven’?”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton instinctively bowed his head
at his wife’s last words, but raised it speedily
as the lady uttered an opinion which was
probably suggested by the holy sentiment
she had just expressed.</p>

<p>“Then you allowed them to be dreadfully
irreverent in their conversations about sacred
things,” said she.</p>

<p>“Really, my dear,” expostulated the victim,
“you must charge up some of these
faults to the children’s parents. I had
nothing to do with the formation of the
children’s habits, and their peculiar habit of
talking about what you call sacred things is
inherited directly from their parents. Their
father says he doesn’t believe it was ever intended
that mere mention of a man in the
Bible should be a patent of sacredness, and
Helen agrees with him.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p004.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">MRS. BURTON BRUSHED A TINY CRUMB FROM HER ROBE</div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Burton coughed. It is surprising
what a multitude of suggestions can be conveyed
by a gentle cough.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” she said slowly, as if musing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
aloud, “that inheritance <i>is</i> the method by
which children obtain many objectionable
qualities for which they themselves are
blamed, poor little things. I don’t know
how to sympathize in the least degree with
this idea of Tom’s and Helen’s, for the Maytons,
and my mother’s family, too, have
always been extremely reverent toward
sacred things. You are right in laying the
fault to them instead of the boys, but I
cannot see how they can bear to inflict such
a habit upon innocent children and I must
say that I can’t see how they can tolerate it
in each other.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton raised her napkin, and with
fastidious solicitude brushed a tiny crumb or
two from her robe as she finished this remark.
Dear creature! She needed to display a
human weakness to convince her husband
that she was not altogether too good for
earth, and this implication of a superiority
of origin, the darling idea of every woman
but Eve, answered the purpose. Her spouse
endured the infliction as good husbands
always do in similar cases, though he somewhat
hastily passed his coffee-cup for more
sugar, and asked, in a tone in which self-restraint
was distinctly perceptible:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>“What else, my dear?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton suddenly comprehended the
situation; she left her chair, made the one
atonement which is always sufficient between
husband and wife, and said:</p>

<p>“Only one thing, you dear old boy, and
even that is a repetition, I suppose. It’
only this: parents are quite as remiss as loving
uncles in training their children, instead
of merely watching them. The impress of
the older and wiser mind should be placed
upon the child from the earliest dawn of its
intelligence, so that the little one’s shall be
determined, instead of being left to chance.”</p>

<p>“And the impress is readily made, of
course, even by a love-struck uncle on a
short vacation?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Even wild animals are often
tamed at sight by master-minds.”</p>

<p>“But suppose these impressible little beings
should have opinions and wishes and
intentions of their own?”</p>

<p>“They should be overcome by the adult
mind.”</p>

<p>“And if they object?”</p>

<p>“That should make no difference,” said
Mrs. Burton, gaining suddenly an inch or
two in stature and queenly beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>“Do you mean that you would really make
them obey you?” asked Mr. Burton, with a
gaze as reverent as if the answer would be by
absolute authority.</p>

<p>“Certainly!” replied the lady, adding a grace
or two to her fully aroused sense of command.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed her husband,
“what a remarkable coincidence! That is
just what I determined upon when I first
took charge of those boys. And yet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And yet you failed,” said Mrs. Burton.
“How I wish I had been in your place!”</p>

<p>“So do I, my dear,” said Mr. Burton;
“or, at least, I would wish so if I didn’t
realize that if you had had charge of those
children instead of I, there wouldn’t have
occurred any of the blessed accidents that
helped to make you Mrs. Burton.”</p>

<p>The lady smiled lovingly, but answered:</p>

<p>“I may have the opportunity yet; in fact&mdash;oh,
it’s too bad that I haven’t yet learned
how to keep anything secret from you&mdash;I
have arranged for just such an experiment.
And I’m sure that Helen and Tom, as well
as you, will learn that I am right.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you will try it while I’m away
on my spring trip among the dealers?”
queried Mr. Burton hastily. “Or,” he con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>tinued, “if
not, I know you love me well
enough to give me timely notice, so I can
make a timely excuse to get away from home.
When is it to be?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton replied by a look which her
husband was failing to comprehend when
there came help to him from an unexpected
source. There were successive and violent
rings of the door-bell, and as many tremendous
pounds, apparently with a brick, at the
back door. Then there ensued a violent
slamming of doors, a trampling in the hall
as of many war-horses, and a loud, high-pitched
shout of, “I got in fyst,” and a louder,
deeper one of “So did I!” And then, as Mr.
and Mrs. Burton sprang from their chairs
with faces full of apprehension and inquiry
the dining-room door opened and Budge and
Toddie shot in as if propelled from a catapult.</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Budge, by way of
greeting, as Toddie wriggled from his aunt’
embrace, and seized the tail of the family
terrier. “What do you think? We’ve got
a new baby, and Tod and I have come down
here to stay for a few days; papa told us to.
Don’t seem to me you had a very nice breakbux,”
concluded Budge, after a critical survey
of the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<p>“And it’s only jus’ about so long,” said
Toddie, from whose custody the dog Terry
had hurriedly removed his tail by the conclusive
proceeding of conveying his whole
body out of doors&mdash;“only jus’ so long!” repeated
Toddie, placing his pudgy hands a
few inches apart, and contracting every
feature of his countenance, as if to indicate
the extreme diminutiveness of the new heir.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p009.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“IT’S ONLY JUS’ ABOUT SO LONG”.</div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Burton kissed her nephews and her
husband with more than usual fervor and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
inquired as to the sex of the new inhabitant.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s the nicest thing about it,”
said Budge. “It’s a girl. I’m tired of such
lots of boys&mdash;Tod is as bad as a whole lot,
you know, when I have to take care of him.
Only, now we’re bothered, ’cause we don’t
know what to name her. Mamma told us to
think of the loveliest thing in all the world,
so I thought about squash-pie right away;
but Tod thought of molasses candy, and then
papa said neither of ’em would do for the
name of a little girl. I don’t see that they’re
not as good as roses and violets, and all the
other things that they name little girls after.”</p>

<p>During the delivery by Budge of this information,
Toddie had been steadily exclaiming,
“I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;!” like a
prudent parliamentarian who wants to make
sure of recognition by the chair. In his excitement,
he failed to realize for some seconds
that his brother had concluded, but he finally
exclaimed: “An’ I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I’m goin’ to
give her my turtle, an’ show her how to make
mud pies wif currants in ’em.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” said Budge, with inexpressible
contempt in his tones. “Girls don’t like such
things. I’m going to give her my blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
necktie, and take her riding in the goat-carriage.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow,” said Toddie, with the air
of a man who was wresting victory from the
jaws of defeat, “I’ll give her caterpillars. I
know she’ll be sure to like them, ’cause
they’e got lovely fur jackets all heavenly-green
an’ red an’ brown, like ladies’s djesses.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t know what lots of prayin’
Tod and me had to do to get that baby,” said
Budge. “My! It just makes me ache to
think about it! Whole days and weeks and
months!”</p>

<p>“Yesh,” said Toddie. “An’ Budgie sometimes
was goin’ to stop, ’caush he fought the
Lord was too busy to listen to us. But I
just told him that the Lord was our biggesht
papa, an’ just what papas ought to be, an’
papa at home was just like papas ought to
be. An’ the baby comeded. Oh! Yesh,
an’ we had to be awful good too. Why don’t
you be real good an’ pray lots? Then maybe
you’ll get a dear, sweet, little baby!”</p>

<p>The temporary reappearance of the dog,
Terry, put an end to the dispute, for both
boys moved toward him, which movement
soon developed into a lively chase. Being
not unacquainted with the boys, and know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>ing
their tender mercies to be much like those
of the wicked, Terry sought and found a
forest retreat and the boys came panting
back and sat dejectedly upon the well-curb.
Mrs. Burton, who stood near the window,
leaning upon her husband’s shoulder, looked
tenderly upon them, and murmured:</p>

<p>“The poor little darlings are homesick
already. Now is the time for my reign to
begin. Boys!”</p>

<p>Both boys looked up at the window. Mrs.
Burton gracefully framed a well-posed picture
of herself as she leaned upon the sill, and
her husband hung admiringly upon her
words. “Boys, come into the house, and
let’s have a lovely talk about mamma.”</p>

<p>“Don’t want to talk about mamma,” said
Toddie, a suspicion of a snarl modifying his
natural tones. “Wantsh the dog.”</p>

<p>“But mammas and babies are so much
nicer than dogs,” pleaded Mrs. Burton, after
a withering glance at her husband, who had
received Toddie’s remark with a titter.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think so,” said Budge, reflectively.
“We can always see mamma and
the baby, but Terry we can only see once in a
while, and he never wants to see us, somehow.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” said Mr. Burton humbly, “if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
you care for the experience of another, my
advice is that you let those boys come out of
their disappointment themselves. They’ll
do it in their own way in spite of you.”</p>

<p>“There are experiences,” remarked Mrs.
Burton, with chilling dignity, “which are
useful only through the realization of their
worthlessness. Anyone can let children
alone. Darlings, did you ever hear the story
of little Patty Pout?”</p>

<p>“No,” growled Budge, in a manner that
would have discouraged any one not conscious
of having been born to rule.</p>

<p>“Well, Patty Pout was a nice little girl,”
said Mrs. Burton, “except that she would
sulk whenever things did not happen just as
she wanted them to. One day she had a
stick of candy, and was playing ‘lose and
find’ with it; but she happened to put it
away so carefully that she forgot where it
was, so she sat down to sulk, and suddenly
there came up a shower and melted that
stick of candy, which had been just around
the corner all the while.”</p>

<p>“Is Terry just around the corner?” asked
Toddie, jumping up, while Budge suddenly
scraped the dirt with the toes of his shoes
and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>“If Patty’d et up her candy while she
had it, she wouldn’t have had any
trouble.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton hurried into the back parlor to
laugh comfortably, and without visible disrespect,
while Mrs. Burton remembered that
it was time to ring the cook and chambermaid
to breakfast. A moment or two later
she returned to the window, but the boys
were gone; so was a large stone jar, which
was one of those family heirlooms which are
abhorred by men but loved as dearly by
women as ancestral robes or jewels. Mrs.
Burton had that mania for making preserves
which posterity has inflicted upon even some
of the brightest and best members of the race,
and the jar referred to had been carefully
scalded that morning and set in the sun,
preparatory to being filled with raspberry jam.</p>

<p>“Harry,” said Mrs. Burton, “won’t you
step out and get that jar for me? It must
be dry by this time.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton consulted his watch, and replied:</p>

<p>“I’ve barely time to catch the fast train to
town, my dear, but the boys won’t fail to get
back by dinner-time. Then you may be able
to ascertain the jar’s whereabouts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>Mr. Burton hurried from the front door,
and his wife made no less haste in the opposite
direction. The boys were invisible, and
a careful glance at the adjacent country
showed no traces of them. Mrs. Burton
called the cook and chambermaid, and the
three women took, each one, a roadway
through the lightly wooded ground near the
house. Mrs. Burton soon recognized familiar
voices, and following them to their
source, she emerged from the wood near the
rear of the boys’s own home. Going closer,
she traced the voices to the Lawrence barn,
and she appeared before the door of that
structure to see her beloved jar in the middle
of the floor, and full of green tomatoes, over
which the boys were pouring the contents of
bottles labeled “Mustang Liniment” and
“Superior Carriage Varnish.” The boys
became conscious of the presence of their
aunt, and Toddie, with a smile in which confidence
blended with the assurance of success
attained, said:</p>

<p>“We’s makin’ pickles for you, ’cause you
told us a nysh little story. This is just the
way mamma makes ’em, only we couldn’t
make the stuff in the bottles hot.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton’s readiness of expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
seemed to fail her, and as she abruptly quitted
the spot, with a hand of each nephew in
her own, Budge indicated the nature of her
feelings by exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Ow! Aunt Alice! don’t squeeze my hand
so hard!”</p>

<p>“Boys,” said Mrs. Burton, “why did you
take my jar without permission?”</p>

<p>“What did you say?” asked Budge. “Do
you mean what did we take it for?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Why, we wanted to give you a s’prise.”</p>

<p>“You certainly succeeded,” said Mrs. Burton,
without a moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“You must give us s’prises, too,” said
Toddie. “S’prises is lovaly; papa gives us
lots of ’em. Sometimes they’s candy, but
they’s nicest when they’s buttonanoes”
(bananas).</p>

<p>“How would you like to be shut up in a dark
room all morning, to think about the naughty
thing you’ve done?” asked Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Huh!” replied Budge. “That wouldn’t
be no s’prise at all. We can do that any
time that we do anything bad, and papa and
mamma finds out. Why, you forgot to
bring your pickles home! I don’t think you
act very nice about presents and s’prises.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p017.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“WE’S MAKIN’s PICKLES FOR YOU”</div>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Burton did not explain nor did she
spend much time in conversation. When she
reached her own door, however, she turned
and said:</p>

<p>“Now, boys, you may play anywhere in
the yard that you like, but you must not go
away or come into
the house until I
call you, at twelve
o’clock. I shall
be very busy this
morning, and must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
not be disturbed. You will try to be good
boys, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I will,” exclaimed Toddie, turning up an
honest little face for a kiss, and dragging his
aunt down until he could put his arms about
her and give her an affectionate hug. Budge
seemed lost in meditation, but the sound of
the closing of the door brought him back
to earth; he threw the door open, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Come here&mdash;I want to ask you something.”</p>

<p>“It’s your business to come to me, Budge,
if you have a favor to ask,” said Mrs. Burton,
from the parlor.</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, what I want to know is, how
did the Lord make the first hornet&mdash;the very
first one that ever was?”</p>

<p>“Just the way he made everything else,”
replied Mrs. Burton. “Just by wanting it
done.”</p>

<p>“Then did Noah save hornets in the ark?”
continued Budge. “’Cause I don’t see how
he kept ’em from stingin’ his boys and girls,
and then gettin’ killed ’emselves.”</p>

<p>“You ask me about it after lunch, Budge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>”
said Mrs. Burton, “and I will tell you all I
can. Now run and play.”</p>

<p>The door closed again, and Mrs. Burton,
somewhat confused, but still resolute, seated
herself at the piano for practice. She had
been playing perhaps ten minutes, when a
long-drawn sigh from some one not herself
caused her to turn hastily and behold the boy
Budge. A stern reproof was ready, but
somehow it never reached the young man.
Mrs. Burton afterward explained her silence
by saying that Budge’s countenance was so
utterly doleful that she was sure his active
conscience had realized the impropriety of
his affair with the jar, and he had come to
confess.</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice,” said Budge, “do you know
I don’t think much of your garden? There
ain’t a turtle to be found in it from one end
to the other, and no nice grassy place to
slide down like there is at our house.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you understand, little boy,” replied
Mrs. Burton, “that we arranged the
house and grounds to suit ourselves, and not
little boys who come to see us?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think that was a very nice
thing to do,” said Budge. “My papa says
we ought to care as much about pleasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
other folks as we do for ourselves. I didn’t
want to make you that jar of pickles, but
Tod said ’twould be nice for you, so I went
and did it, instead of askin’ a man that drove
past to give me a ride. That’s the way you
ought to do about gardens.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you run out now,” said Mrs.
Burton, “I told you not to come in until I
called you.”</p>

<p>“But you see I came in for my top&mdash;I laid
it down in the dining-room when I came in,
and now it ain’t there at all. I’d like to
know what you’ve done with it, and why
folks can’t let little boys’s things alone.”</p>

<p>“Budge,” exclaimed Mrs. Burton, turning
suddenly on the piano-stool, “I think there’
a very cross little boy around here somewhere.
Suppose I were to lose something?”</p>

<p>“’Twas a three-cent top,” said Budge.
“’Twasn’t only a something.”</p>

<p>“Suppose, then, that I were to lose a top,”
said Mrs. Burton, “what do you suppose I
would do if I wanted it very much?”</p>

<p>“You’d call the servant to find it&mdash;that’
what I want you to do now,” said Budge.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t do anything of the kind.
Try to think, now, of what a sensible person
ought to do in such a case.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>Budge dejectedly traced with his toe one
of the figures in the carpet, and seemed buried
in thought; suddenly, however, his face
brightened, and he looked up shyly and said,
with an infinite scale of inflection:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would find out,” said
Mrs. Burton, with an encouraging kiss and
embrace, which Budge terminated quite
abruptly.</p>

<p>“One victory to report to my superior
officer, the dear old humbug,” murmured
Mrs. Burton, as she turned again to the keyboard.
But before the lady could again put
herself <i>en rapport</i> with the composer Budge
came flying into the room with a radiant face,
and the missing top.</p>

<p>“I told you I knew what you’d do,” said
he, “an’ I just went and done it. I prayed
about it. I went up-stairs into a chamber
and shut the door, and knelt down an’ said,
‘Dear Lord, bless everybody, an’ don’t let
me be bad, an’ help me to find that top again,
an’ don’t let me have to pray for it as long as
I had to pray for that baby.’s And then when
I came down-stairs there was that top on the
register, just where I left it. Say, Aunt
Alice, I think brekbux was an awful long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
while ago. Don’t you have cakes and
oranges to give to little boys?”</p>

<p>“Children should never eat between meals,”
Mrs. Burton replied. “It spoils their digestion
and makes them cross.”</p>

<p>“Then I guess my digestion’s spoilt already,”
said Budge, “for I’m awful cross
sometimes, an’ you can’t spoil a bad egg;&mdash;that’
what Mike says. So I guess I’d better
have some cake; I like the kind with raisins
an’ citron best.”</p>

<p>“Only this once,” murmured Mrs. Burton
to herself, as she led the way to the dining-room
closet, partly for the purpose of hiding
her own face. “And I won’t tell Harry
about it,” she continued, with greater energy.
“Here’s a little piece for Toddie, too,” said
Mrs. Burton, “and I want you both to remember
that I don’t want you to come indoors
until you’re called.”</p>

<p>Budge disappeared, and his aunt had an
hour so peaceful that she began to react
against it and started to call her nephews
into the house. Budge came in hot haste in
answer to her call, and volunteered the information
that the Burton chicken-coop was
much nicer than the one at his own house, for
the latter was without means of ingress for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
small boys. Toddy, however, came with
evident reluctance, and stopped <i>en route</i> to sit
on the grass and gyrate thereon in a very constrained
manner.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Toddie?” asked Mrs.
Burton, who speedily discerned that the
young man was ill at ease.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p023.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“I GOT INTO A HEN’S NESHT WHERE THERE WAS SOME EGGS”</div>
</div>


<p>“Why,” said
Toddie, “I got
into a hen’
nesht where
there was some
eggs, an’ made
believe I was a henny-penny that was goin’
to hatch little tsickens, an’ some of ’em was
goin’ to be brown, an’ some white an’ some
black, an’ dey was all goin’ to be such dear
little fuzzy balls, an’ dey was goin’ to sleep in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
the bed wif me every night, an’ I was goin’ to
give one of de white ones to dat dear little
baby sister, an’ one of ’em to you, ’cause you
was sweet, too, an’ dey was all goin’ to have
tsickens of deir own some day, an’ I sitted
down in de nesht ever so soffaly ’cause I
hasn’t got fevvers, you know, an’ when I got
up dere wasn’t nuffin dere but a nasty muss.
An’ I don’t feel comfitable.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton grasped the situation at once,
and shouted: “Toddie, sit down on the
grass. Budge, run home and ask Maggie for a
clean suit for Toddie. Jane, fill the bathtub.”</p>

<p>“Don’t want to sit on the gwass,” whined
Toddie. “I feels bad, an’ I wantsh to be loved.”</p>

<p>“Aunty loves you very much, Toddie,”
said Mrs. Burton, tenderly. “Doesn’t that
make you happy?”</p>

<p>“No,” exclaimed the youth with great emphasis.
“Dat kind of lovin’ don’t do no
good to little boys with eggy dresses.
Wantsh you to come out an’ sit down by me
an’ love me.”</p>

<p>Toddie’s eyes said more than his lips, so
Mrs. Burton hurried out to him, prudently
throwing a light shawl about her waist.
Toddie greeted her with an effusiveness which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
was touching in more senses than one, as
Mrs. Burton’s morning robe testified by the
time Budge returned. Carefully enveloped
in a hearth-rug, Toddie was then conveyed to
the bathroom, and when he emerged he was
so satisfied with the treatment he had received
that he remarked:</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice, will you give me a forough
baff every day, if I try to hatch out little
tsickens for you?”</p>

<p>The events of the morning resulted in
luncheon being an hour late, so Mrs. Burton
was compelled to make considerable haste in
preparing herself for a round of calls. She
was too self-possessed, however, to forget the
possible risks to which her home would be
subjected during her absence, so she called
her nephews to her and proceeded to instruct
them in the duties and privileges of the
afternoon.</p>

<p>“Darlings,” she said, putting an arm
around each boy, “Aunt Alice must be away
this afternoon for an hour or two. I wonder
who will take care of the house for her?”</p>

<p>“I want to go wif you,” said Toddie, with a
kiss.</p>

<p>“I can’t take you, dear,” said the lady,
after returning Toddie’s salute. “The walk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
will be too long; but auntie will come back to
her dear little Toddie as soon as she can.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re goin’ to walk to where you’
goin’, are you?” said Toddie, wriggling from
his aunt’s arm. “Den I wouldn’t go wif you
for noffin’ in the wyld.”</p>

<p>The pressure of Mrs. Burton’s arm relaxed,
but she did not forget her duty.</p>

<p>“Listen, boys,” said she. “Don’t you
like to see houses neatly and properly arranged,
like your mamma’s and mine?”</p>

<p>“I do!” said Budge. “I always think
heaven must be that way, with parlors an’
pictures an’ books an’ a piano. Only they
don’t ever have to sweep in heaven, do they,
’cause there ain’t no dirt there. But I
wonder what the Lord does to make the
little angels happy when they want to make
dirt-pies, and can’t?”</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice will have to explain that to
you when she comes back, Budge. But
little angels never want to make mud-pies.”</p>

<p>“Why, papa says people’s spirits don’t
change when they die,” said Budge. “So
how can little boy angels help it?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton silently vowed that at a more
convenient season she would deliver a course
of systematic theology which should correct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
her brother-in-law’s loose teachings. At
present, however, the sun was hurrying toward
Asia, and she had made but little progress
in securing insurance against accident
to household goods.</p>

<p>“You both like nicely arranged rooms,”
pursued Mrs. Burton, but Toddie demurred.</p>

<p>“I don’t like ’em,” said he. “They’re the
kind of places where folks always says
‘Don’t!’s to little boysh that wantsh to have
nysh times.”</p>

<p>“But, Toddie,” reasoned Mrs. Burton,
“the way to have nice times is to learn to
enjoy what is nicest. People have been
studying how to make homes pretty ever
since the world began.”</p>

<p>“Adam an’ Eve didn’t,” said Toddie.
“Lord done it for ’em; an’ he let ’em do just
what dey wanted to. I bet little Cain an’
Abel had more fun than any uvver little
boys dat ever was.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, they didn’t,” said Mrs. Burton,
“because they never were in that lovely
garden. Their parents had to think and
plan a long time to make their home beautiful.
Just think, now, how many people
have had to plan and contrive before the
world got to be as pleasant a place as it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
now! When you look at your mamma’
parlor and mine, you see what thousands and
millions of people have had to work to bring
about.”</p>

<p>“Gwacious!” exclaimed Toddie, his eyes
opening wider and wider. “Dat’s wonnerful!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and every nice person alive is doing
the same now,” continued Mrs. Burton,
greatly encouraged by the impression she
had made, “and little boys should try to do
the same. Every one should, instead of disturbing
what is beautiful, try to enjoy it,
and want to make it better instead of worse.
Even little boys should feel that way.”</p>

<p>“I’e goin’ to ’member that,” said Toddie,
with a far-away look. “I fink it awful nysh
for little boys to fink the same finks dat big
folks do.”</p>

<p>“Dear little boy,” said Mrs. Burton, arising.
“Then you won’t let anybody disturb
anything in Aunt Alice’s house, will you?
You’ll take care of everything for her just as
if you were a big man, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yesh, indeedy,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“An’ me, too,” said Budge.</p>

<p>“You’re two manly little fellows, and I
shall have to bring you something real nice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>”
said Mrs. Burton, kissing her nephews good-by.
“There!” she whispered to herself, as
she passed out of the garden-gate, “I wonder
what my lord and master will say of that
victory over imperfect natures, of the sense
of the fitness of things? He would have left
the boys under the care of the servants; I
am proud of having been able to leave them
to themselves.”</p>

<p>On her return, two hours later, Mrs. Burton
was met at her front door by two very
dirty little boys, with faces full of importance
and expectancy.</p>

<p>“We done just what you told us, Aunt
Alice,” said Toddie. “We didn’t touch a
thing, an’ we thought of everything we
could do to make the world prettier. D’just
come see.”</p>

<p>With a quickened step Mrs. Burton followed
her nephews into the back parlor.
Furniture, pictures, books, and bric-a-brac
were exactly as she left them, but some improvements
had been designed and partly
executed. A bit of wall several feet long,
and bare from floor to ceiling, except for a
single picture, had long troubled Mrs. Burton’
artistic eye, and she now found that
tasteful minds, like great ones, think alike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p>“I think no room is perfect without flowers,”
said Budge; “so does papa an’ mamma,
so we thought we’d s’prise you with some.”</p>

<p>On the floor, in a heap which was not without
tasteful arrangement, was almost a cartload
of stones disposed as a rockery, and on
the top thereof, and working through the
crevices, was a large quantity of street dust.
From several of the crevices protruded ferns,
somewhat wilted, and bearing evidence of
having been several times disarranged and
dropped upon the dry soil which partly covered
their roots. Around the base was
twined several yards of Virginia creeper
while from the top sprang a well-branched
specimen of the “Datura stramonium” (the
common “stink-weed”). The three conservators
of the beautiful gazed in silence for a
moment, and then Toddie looked up with angelic
expression and said:</p>

<p>“Isn’t it lovaly?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p030.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“ISN’T IT LOVALY?”</div>
</div>


<p>“I hope what you brought us is real nice,”
remarked Budge, “for ’twas awful hard
work to make that rockery. I guess I never
was so tired in all my life. Mamma’s is on a
big box, but we couldn’t find any boxes anywhere,
an’ we couldn’t find the servants to
ask ’em. That ain’t the kind of datura that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
has flowers just like pretty vases, but papa
says it’s more healthy than the tame kind.
The ferns look kind o’s thirsty, but I couldn’t
see how to water ’em without wettin’ the
carpet, so I thought I’d wait till you came
home, and ask you about it.”</p>

<p>There was a sudden rustle of silken robes
and two little boys found themselves alone.
When, half an hour later, Mr. Burton returned
from the city, he found his wife more
reticent than he had ever known her to be,
while two workmen with market baskets
were sifting dust upon his hall-carpets and
making a stone-heap in the gutter in front of
the house.</p>

</div><div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>On the morning of the second day of Mrs.
Burton’s experiment, the aunt of Budge
and Toddie awoke with more than her usual
sense of the responsibility and burden of life.
Her husband’s description of a charming lot
of bric-à-brac and pottery soon to be sold at
auction did not stimulate as much inquiry as
such announcements usually did, and Mrs.
Burton’s cook did not have her usual early
morning visit from her watchful mistress.
Mrs. Burton was wondering which of her
many duties to her nephews should be first
attended to; but, as she wondered long without
reaching any conclusion an ever-sympathizing
Providence came to her assistance,
for the children awoke and created such a
hubbub directly over her head that she speedily
determined that reproof was the first
thing in order. Dressing hastily, she went up
to the chamber of the innocents, and learned
that the noise was occasioned by a heavy
antique center-table, which was flying back
and forth across the room, the motive power
consisting of two pairs of sturdy little arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>“Hullo, Aunt Alice!” said Budge. “I
awful glad you came in. The table’s a choo-choo,
you know, an’ my corner’s New York
an’ Tod’s is Hillcrest, an’ he’s ticket-agent at
one place an’ I at the other. But the choo-choo
hasn’t got any engineer, an’ we have to
push it, an’ it isn’t fair for ticket-agents to do
so much work besides their own. Now you
can be engineer. Jump on!”</p>

<p>The extempore locomotive was accommodatingly
pushed up to Mrs. Burton with such
force as to disturb her equilibrium, but she
managed to say:</p>

<p>“Do you do this way with your mamma’
guest-chamber furniture?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Toddie, “’cause why, ’pare-chamber’h
always lockted. B’ides dat,
papa once tookted all de wheels off our
tables&mdash;said tables wash too restless.”</p>

<p>“Little boys,” said Mrs. Burton, returning
the table to its place, “should never use things
which belong to other people without asking
permission. Nor should they ever use anything,
no matter who it belongs to, in any way
but that in which it was made to be used.
Did either of you ever see a table on a railroad?”</p>

<p>“’Coursh we did,” said Toddie, promptly;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
“dere’s a tyne-table at Hillcrest, an’annuvver
at Dzersey City. How could choo-choos
turn around if dere wasn’t?”</p>

<p>“It’s time to dress for breakfast now,” said
Mrs. Burton in some confusion, as she departed.</p>

<p>The children appeared promptly at the
table on the ringing of the bell and brought
ravenous appetites with them. Mrs. Burton
composed a solemn face, rapped on the table
with the handle of the carving-knife, and all
heads were bowed while the host and hostess
silently returned thanks. When the adults
raised their heads they saw that two juvenile
faces were still closely hidden in two pairs of
small hands. Mrs. Burton reverently nodded
at each one to attract her husband’
attention, and mentally determined that souls
so absorbed in thanksgiving were good ground
for better spiritual seed than their parents
had ever scattered. Slowly, however, twice
ten little fingers separated, and very large
eyes peeped inquiringly between them; then
Budge suddenly dropped his hands, straightened
himself in his chair, and said:</p>

<p>“Why, Uncle Harry! Have you been forgettin’
again how to ask a blessin’?”</p>

<p>And Toddie, looking somewhat complain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>ingly
at his uncle, and very hungrily at the
steak, remarked:</p>

<p>“Said my blessin’ ’bout fifty timesh.”</p>

<p>“Once would have been sufficient, Toddie,”
said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you say yoursh once, den?”
asked Toddie.</p>

<p>“I did. We don’t need to talk aloud to
have the Lord hear us,” explained Mrs.
Burton.</p>

<p>“’Posin’ you don’t,” said Toddie, “I don’t
fink it’s a very nysh way to do, to whisper
fings to de Lord. When I whisper anyfing
mamma says, ‘Toddie, what’s you whisperin’
for? You ’shamed of somefing?’s Guesh you
an’ Uncle Harry’s bofe ’shamed at de same
time.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton desired to give his wife a pertinent
hint yet dared not while two such vigilant
pairs of ears were present. A happy thought
struck him and he said in very bad German:</p>

<p>“Is it not time for the reformation to
begin?”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Burton answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It soon will be.”</p>

<p>“That’s awful funny talk,” said Budge.
“I wish I could talk that way. That’s just
the way ragged, dirty men talk to my papa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
sometimes, and then he gives ’em lots of
pennies. When was you an’ Aunt Alice
ragged an’ dirty, so as to learn to talk that
way?”</p>

<p>“Budge, Budge!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton.
“Thousands of very rich and handsome people
talk that way&mdash;all German people do.”</p>

<p>“Do they talk to the Lord so?” asked
Budge.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” exclaimed the young man.
“He must be awful smart to understand
them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton repeated his question in
German, but Mrs. Burton kept silent and
looked extremely serious, with a ghost of a
frown.</p>

<p>“What are you boys and your auntie going
to do with yourselves to-day?” asked
Mr. Burton, anxious to clear away the cloud
of reticence which, since the night before,
had been marring his matrimonial sky.</p>

<p>“I guess,” said Budge, looking out through
the window, “it’s going to rain; so the best
thing will be for Aunt Alice to tell us stories
all day long. We never do get enough
stories.”</p>

<p>“Just the thing!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
her face coming from behind the clouds, and
with more than its usual radiance.</p>

<p>“Hazh you got plenty of stories in your
’tomach?” asked Toddie, poising his fork in
air, regardless of the gravy which trickled
down upon his hand from the fragment of
meat at the end.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p037.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“RAGGED, DIRTY MEN TALK TO MY PAPA SOMETIMES”</div>
</div>


<p>“Dozens of them,” said Mrs. Burton. “I
listened to stories in Sunday-school for about
ten years, and I’ve never had anybody to tell
them to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>“I don’t think much of Sunday-school
stories,” said Budge, with the air of a man
indulging in an unsatisfactory retrospect.
“There’s always somethin’ at the end of
’em that spoils all the good taste of ’em&mdash;somethin’
about bein’ good little boys.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice’s stories haven’t any such
endings,” said Mr. Burton, with a sneaking
desire to commit his wife to a policy of simple
amusement. “She knows that little boys
want to be good, and she wants to see them
happy, too.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice will tell you only what you
will enjoy, Budge&mdash;she promises you that,”
said Mrs. Burton. “We will send Uncle
Harry away right after breakfast and then
you shall have all the stories you want.”</p>

<p>“And cake, too?” asked Toddie. “Mamma
always gives us cakesh when she’s tellin’
us stories, so we’ll sit still an’ not wriggle
about.”</p>

<p>“No cakes,” said Mrs. Burton, kindly but
firmly. “Eating between meals spoils the
digestion of little boys, and makes them very
cross.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s what was the matter with
Terry yesterday, then,” said Budge. “He
was eatin’ a bone between meals, out in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
garden yesterday afternoon, and when I took
hold of his back legs and tried to play that
he was a wheelbarrow, he bit me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton gave the dog Terry a sympathetic
pat and a bit of meat, making him
stand on his hind legs and beg for the latter,
to the great diversion of the children. Then,
with an affectionate kiss and a look of tender
solicitude he wished his wife a happy day and
hurried off to the city. Mrs. Burton took
the children into the library and picked up
a Bible.</p>

<p>“What sort of story would you like first?”
she asked, as she slowly turned the leaves.</p>

<p>“One ’bout Abraham, ’cause he ’most
killed somebody,” said Toddie, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Budge; “one about Jesus,
because He was always good to everybody.”</p>

<p>“Dear child,” exclaimed Mrs. Burton.
“Goodness always makes people nice, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Budge; “’cept when they talk
about it to little boys. Say, Aunt Alice,
what makes good folks always die?”</p>

<p>“Because the Lord needs them, I suppose,
Budge.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t he need me?” asked Budge,
with a pathetic look of inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>“Certainly, dear,” said Mrs. Burton; “but
he wants you to make other people happy
first. A great many good people are left in
the world for the same reason.”</p>

<p>“Then why couldn’t Jesus be left?” said
Budge. “He could make people happier
than every one else put together.”</p>

<p>“You’ll understand why, when you grow
older,” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“I wish I’d hurry up about it and grow,
then,” said Budge. “Why can’t little boys
grow just like little flowers do?&mdash;just be put
in the ground an’ watered and hoed? Our
’paragus grows half-a-foot in a day almost.”</p>

<p>“You’s a dyty boy to want to be put in
de dyte, Budgie,” said Toddie, “an’ I isn’t
goin’ to play wif you any more. Mamma
says I mustn’t play wif dyty little boys.”</p>

<p>“Dirty boy yourself!” retorted Budge.
“You like to play in the dirt, only you cry
whenever anybody comes with water to put
on you. Say, Aunt Alice, how long does people
have to stay in the ground when they die
before they go to heaven?”</p>

<p>“Three days, I suppose, Budge,” said Mrs.
Burton.</p>

<p>“An’ does everybody that the Lord loves
go up to heaven?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p>“Well, papa says some folks believe that
dead people never go to heaven.”</p>

<p>“Never mind what they believe, Budge.
You should believe what you are taught,”
said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“But I’d like to know for sure.”</p>

<p>“So you will, some day.”</p>

<p>“I wish ’twould be pretty quick about
it, then,” said Budge. “Now tell us a
story.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton drew the children nearer her
as she reopened the Bible, when she discovered,
to her surprise, that Toddie was
crying.</p>

<p>“I hazhn’t talked a bit for ever so long!”
he exclaimed, in a high, pathetic tremolo.</p>

<p>“What do you want to say, Toddie?”
asked Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“I know all ’bout burying folks&mdash;that’
what,” said Toddie. “Mamma tolded me all
’bout it one time, she did. An’ yeshterday
me and Budgie had a funelal all by ourselves.
We found a dear little dead byde. An’ we
w’apped it up in a piesh of paper, ’cause a
baking-powder box wazn’t bid enough for a
coffin, an’ we dugged a little grave, an’ we
knelted down an’ said a little prayer, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>’
ashked de Lord to take it up to hebben, an’
den we put dyte in the grave an’ planted
little flowers all over it. Dat’s what.”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ we put a little stone at the head
of the grave, too, just like big dead folks,”
said Budge. “We couldn’t find one with any
writin’ on it, but I went home and got a picture-book
an’ cut out a little picture of a bird,
an’ stuck it on the stone with some tar that I
picked out of the groceryman’ wagon-wheel,
so that when the angel that takes spirits to
heaven comes along, it can see there’s a dead
little birdie there waitin’ for him.”</p>

<p>“Yesh,” added Toddie, “an’ little bydie
ishn’t like us. ’Twon’t have to wunner how
it’ll feel to hazh wings when it gets to be a
angel, ’cause ’twas all used to wings ’fore it
died.”</p>

<p>“Birds don’t go&mdash;&mdash;” began Mrs. Burton,
intending to correct the children’s views as to
the future state of the animal kingdom, when
there flashed through her mind some of the
wonderings of her own girlish days, and the
inability of her riper experience to answer
them, so she again postponed, and with a
renewed sense of its vastness, the duty of
reforming the opinions of her nephews on
things celestial. At about the same time her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
cook sought an interview, and complained of
the absence of two of the silver tablespoons.
Mrs. Burton went into the mingled despondency,
suspicion and anger which is the frequent
condition of all American women who
are unfortunate enough to have servants.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p043.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“YES, AN’ WE PUT A LITTLE STONE AT THE HEAD OF THE
GRAVE”</div>
</div>

<p>“Where is the chambermaid?” she asked.</p>

<p>“An’ ye’s needn’t be a-suspectin’ av her,”
said the cook. “It’s them av yer own family
that I’m thinkin’ hez tuk ’em.” And the
cook glared suggestively upon the boys.
Mrs. Burton accepted the hint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p>“Boys, have either of you taken any of
auntie’s spoons for anything?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Toddie, promptly; and
Budge looked very saintly and shy, as if he
knew something that, through delicacy of
feeling and not fear, he shrank from telling.</p>

<p>“What is it, Budge?” asked Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Why, you see,” said Budge, in the sweetest
of tones, “we wanted somethin’ yesterday
to dig the grave of the birdie with, an’ we
couldn’t think of anything else so nice as
spoons. There was plenty of ugly old iron
ones lyin’ around, but birdies are so sweet
an’ nice that I wouldn’t have none of ’em.
An’ the dinner-dishes was all lyin’ there with
the big silver spoons on top of ’em, so I just
got two of ’em&mdash;they wasn’t washed yet, but
we washed ’em real clean so’s to be real nice
about everythin’, so that if the little birdie’
spirit was lookin’ at us it wouldn’t be disgusted.”</p>

<p>“And where are the spoons now?” demanded
Mrs. Burton, oblivious to all the
witchery of the child’s spirit and appearance.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” said Budge, becoming an ordinary
boy in an instant.</p>

<p>“I doeszh,” said Toddie&mdash;“I put ’em
somewherezh, so when we wanted to play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
housh nexsht time we wouldn’t have to make
b’lieve little sticks was spoons.”</p>

<p>“Show me immediately where they are,”
commanded Mrs. Burton, rising from her
chair.</p>

<p>“Den will you lend ’em to us nexsht time
we playzh housh?” asked Toddie.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Burton, with cruel emphasis.</p>

<p>Toddie pouted, rubbed his knuckles into
his eyes, and led the way to the rear of the
garden where, in a hollow at the base of an
old apple-tree, were the missing spoons.
Wondering whether other valuable property
might not be there, Mrs. Burton cautiously
and with a stick examined the remaining
contents of the hole, and soon discovered one
of her damask napkins.</p>

<p>“Datsh goin’ to be our table-cloff,” explained
Toddie, “an’ dat”&mdash;this, as an unopened
pot of French mustard was unearthed
“is pizzyves” (preserves).</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton placed her property in the
pocket of her apron, led her two nephews into
the house, seated them with violence upon a
sofa, closed the doors noisily, drew a chair
close to the prisoners, and said:</p>

<p>“Now, boys, you are to be punished for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
taking auntie’s things out of the house without
permission.”</p>

<p>“Don’t want to be shpynkted!” screamed
Toddie, in a tone which seemed an attempt
at a musical duet by a saw-filer and an ungreased
wagon-wheel.</p>

<p>“You’re not to be whipped,” continued
Mrs. Burton, “but you must learn not to
touch things without permission. I think
that to go without your dinners would help
you to remember that what you have done
is naughty.”</p>

<p>“Izhe ’most ’tarved to deff,” exclaimed
Toddie, bursting out crying. (N.B. Breakfast
has been finished but a scant hour.)</p>

<p>“Then I will put you into an empty room,
and keep you there until you are sure you
can remember.”</p>

<p>Toddie shrieked as if enduring the thousand
tortures of the Chinese executioner, and
Budge looked as unhappy as if he were a
young man in love and in the throes of reluctant
poesy, but Mrs. Burton led them both
to the attic, and into an empty room, placed
chairs in two corners and a boy in each chair,
and said:</p>

<p>“Don’t either of you move out of a chair.
Just sit still and think how naughty you’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
been. In an hour or two I’ll come back, and
see if you think you can be good boys here-after.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p047.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“DON’T EITHER OF YOU MOVE OUT OF A CHAIR”.</div>
</div>

<p>As Mrs. Burton left the room, she was followed
by a shriek that seemed to pierce the
walls and be heard over half the earth. Turning
hastily, she saw that Toddie, from whom
it had proceeded, had neither fallen out of his
chair, nor been seized by an epileptic fit, nor
stung by some venomous insect; so she closed
the door, locked it, softly placed a chair
against it, sat down softly and listened.
There was silence after the several minutes
required by Toddie to weary of his crying,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
and then Mrs. Burton heard the following
conversation:</p>

<p>“Tod?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“We ought to do something!”</p>

<p>“Chop Aunt Alish into little shnipsh of
bitsh&mdash;datsh what I fink would be nysh.”</p>

<p>“That would be dreadful naughty,” said
Budge, “after we’ve bothered her so! We
ought to do something good, just like big
folks when they’ve been bad.”</p>

<p>“What doezh big folks do?”</p>

<p>“Well, they read the Bible an’ go to
church. But you an’ me can’t go to church,
’cause ’tain’t Sunday, an’ we ain’t got no
Bible, an’ we wouldn’t know how to read it if
we had.”</p>

<p>“Den don’t letsh do noffin’ but be awful
mad,” said the unrepentant Toddie. “I’ll
tell you what we can do. Let’s do like dat
Maggydalen dat mamma’s got a picture of,
and dat was bad an’ got sorry; letsh look
awful doleful and cwosh. See me.”</p>

<p>Toddie apparently gave an illustration of
what he thought the proper penitential countenance
and attitude, for Budge exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I don’t think that would look nice at all.
It makes you look like a dead puppy-dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
with his head turned to one side. I’ll tell you
what; we can’t read Bibles like big folks, but
we can tell stories out of the Bible, an’ that’
bein’ just as good as if we read ’em.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Toddie, repenting at once.
“Letsh! I wantsh to be good just awful.”</p>

<p>“Well, what shall we tell about?” asked
Budge.</p>

<p>“’Bout when Jesus was a little boy,” said
Toddie, “for he was awful good.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Budge; “we’ve been naughty,
an’ we must tell about somebody that was
awful naughty. I think old Pharaoh’s about
the thing.”</p>

<p>“Aw right,” said Toddie. “Tell us ’bout
him.”</p>

<p>“Well, once there was a bad old king down
in Egypt, that had all the Izzyrelites there
an’ made ’em work, an’ when they didn’t
work he had ’em banged. But that dear
little bit of a Moses, that lived in a basket in
the river, grew up to be a man, an’ he just
killed one of Pharaoh’s bad bangers, an’ then
he skooted an’ hid. An’ the Lord saw that
he was the kind of man that was good for
somethin’, so he told him he wanted him to
make Pharaoh let the poor Izzyrelites go
where they wanted to. So Moses went and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
told Pharaoh. An’ Pharaoh said, ’No, you
don’t!’s Then Moses went an’ told the Lord,
an’ the Lord got angry, and turned all the
water in the river into blood.”</p>

<p>“My!” said Toddie. “Then if anybody
wanted to look all bluggy, all he had to do
was to go in bavin’, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“But he wouldn’t let ’em go then,” continued
Budge. “So the Lord made frogs
hop out of all the rivers an’ mud-puddles
everywhere, and they went into all the houses
an’ folks couldn’t keep ’em out.”</p>

<p>“I just wis mamma an’ me’d been in
Egypt, den,” said Toddie. “Den she couldn’t
make me leave my hop-toads out of doors, if
de Lord wanted ’em to stay in de house. I
loves hop-toads. I fwallowed one de uvver
day, an’ it went way down my ’tomach.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t it kick inside of you?” asked
Budge, with natural interest.</p>

<p>“No-o!” said Toddie. “I bited him in two
fyst. But he growed togvver ag’in, an’dzust
hopped right out froo de top of my head.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see the hole he came out of?” said
Budge, starting across the floor.</p>

<p>“It all growded up again right away,” said
Toddie, in haste, “an’ you’s a bad boy to get
out of your chair when Aunt Alice told you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
not to, and you’s got to tell annuvver story
’bout naughty folks to pay for it. Gwon!”</p>

<p>Budge returned to his chair, and continued:</p>

<p>“An’ old Pharaoh went down to Moses’s
house an’ said, ‘Ask the Lord to make the
frogs hop away, an’ you can have your old
Izzyrelites&mdash;I don’t want ’em.’ So the Lord
done it, an’ all the glad old Pharaoh was, was
only ’cause he got rid of ’em; an’ he kept the
Izzyrelites some more. Then the Lord thought
he’d fix ’em sure, so he turned all the dirt into
nasty bugs.”</p>

<p>“What did little boys do den, dat wanted
dyte to make mud-pies of?” asked Toddie.</p>

<p>“Well, the bugs was only made out of dry
dirt,” exclaimed Budge; “just dust like we
kick up in the street, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Toddie. “I wonder if any of
dem bugs was ’tato-bugs?”</p>

<p>“I dunno, but some of ’em was the kind
that mammas catch with fine combs after
their little boys have been playin’ with dirty
children. An’ Pharaoh’s smart men, that
thought they could do everythin’, found they
couldn’t make them bugs.”</p>

<p>“Why-y-y,” drawled Toddie, “did Pharaoh
want some more of ’em?”</p>

<p>“No, I s’pose not, but he stayed bad, so he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
had to catch it again. The Lord sent whole
swarms of flies to Egypt, an’ there wasn’t any
mosquito-nets in that country either. An’
then Pharaoh got good again, an’ the Lord
took the flies away, an Pharaoh got bad again,
so the Lord made all the horses an’ cows
awful sick, an’ they all died.”</p>

<p>“Then couldn’t Pharaoh go out ridin’ at
all?”</p>

<p>“No. He had to walk, even if he wanted
to get to the depot in an awful hurry. An’ it
made him so mad that he said the Izzyrelites
shouldn’t go anyhow. So Moses took a
handful of ashes an’ threw it up in the air
before Pharaoh, an’ everybody in all Egypt
got sore with boils right away.”</p>

<p>“Ow!” said Toddie, “I had some nashty
boils oncesh, but I didn’t know ashes made
’em. I’ll ’member that.”</p>

<p>“An’ Pharaoh said ‘no!’again, so he got
some more bothers. The Lord made great
big lumps of ice tumble down out of heaven,
an’ he made the thunder go bang, an’ the
lightnin’ ran around the ground like our
fizzers did last Fourth of July, an’ it spoiled
all the growing things.”</p>

<p>“Strawberries?” queried Toddie.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>“An’ dear little panzhies?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Poo’s old Pharo’! Gwon.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p053.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“&mdash;BUT I DIDN’T KNOW ASHES MADE ’EM”</div>
</div>

<p>“Then Pharaoh’s friends began to tell him
he was bein’ a goose, thinkin’ he could be
stronger than the Lord, an’ Pharaoh kind o’
thought so himself. So he told Moses that
the men-folks of the Izzyrelites might go
away if they wanted to, but nobody else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>“Mean old fing! Who did he fink was
goin’ to cook fings&mdash;an’ go to school?”</p>

<p>“I dunno, but I guess he had a chance to
think about it, for the Lord made whole
crowds of locusts come. Them’s grasshoppers,
you know, an’ they ate up everythin’
in all the gardens, an’ the folks got half crazy
about it.”</p>

<p>“Den I guesh dey didn’t tell their little
boysh that they mushn’t kill gwasshoppers,
like mamma doesh. Wish I’d been dere!
What did he do den?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he was a selfish old pig, just like he
was before, so the Lord said, ‘Moses, just
hold your hand up to the sky a minute.’ An’
Moses did it, and then it got darker in Egypt
than it is in our coal-bin. Folks couldn’t see
anythin’ anywhere, an’ wherever they was
when it growed dark, they had to stay for
three whole days an’ nights.”</p>

<p>“Gwacious!” Toddie exclaimed. “Wouldn’t
it be drefful if Moses was to go an’ hold his
hand up in the sky while we’s a-sittin’ in
dezhe chairzh? Mebbe he will! Let’s holler
for Aunt Alish!”</p>

<p>“Oh, he can’t do it now, ’cause he’s dead.
Besides that, we ain’t keepin’ any Izzyrelites
from doin’ what they want to. Old Pharaoh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
got awful frightened then, an’ told Moses he
might take all the people away, but they
mustn’t take their things with ’em&mdash;the selfish
old fellow! But Moses knew how hard
the poor Izzyrelites had to work for the few
things they had, so he said they wouldn’t go
unless they could carry everythin’ they owned.
An’ that made Pharaoh mad, an’ he said,
‘Get out! If I catch you here again I’ll kill
you!’s An’ Moses said, ‘Don’t trouble yourself;
you won’t see me again unless you want me.’”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t fink he would,” said Toddie.
“Nobody’s goin’ to vizhit kings dzust to have
deir heads cutted off. Even our shickens
knows enough not to come to Mike when he
wants to cut deir heads off. Gwon!”</p>

<p>“Well, then the Lord told Moses somethin’
that must have made him feel awful. He
told him that next night every biggest boy in
every family was goin’ to be killed by an
angel. Ain’t I glad I didn’t live there then!
I’d like to see an angel, but not if that’s what
he wants to do with me. What would you
do if an angel was to kill me, Tod?”</p>

<p>“I’d have all your marbles,” Toddie answered,
promptly, “and the goat-cawwiage
would be all mine. Gwon!”</p>

<p>“Well, the Lord told Moses about it, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>’
Moses told the folks; an’ he told ’em all to
kill a little lamb, an’ dip their fingers in the
blood, an’ make a cross on their door-posts,
so when the angel came along an’ saw it he
wouldn’t kill the biggest boy in their houses.
An’ that night down came the angel, an’
everybody woke up an’ cried awful&mdash;worse
than you did when you fell down-stairs the
other day, because all the biggest died. You
couldn’t go anywhere without hearin’ papas
an’ mammas cryin’.”</p>

<p>“Did dey all have funerals den?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Gwacious! Den the little ’Gyptian boys
dat didn’t get killed could look at deaders all
day long! What did Pharo’s do ’bout it
den?”</p>

<p>“He sent right after Moses an’ his brother,
in a hurry, an’ he told ’em that he’d been a
bad king&mdash;just as if they didn’t know that
already! An’ he told ’em to take all the
Izzyrelites, an’ all their things, an’ go right
straight away&mdash;he was in such a hurry that
he didn’t even invite Moses to the funeral,
though he had a dead biggest boy himself.
An’ all the Egyptian people came too, and
begged the Izzyrelites to hurry an’ go&mdash;they
didn’t see what they was waitin’ for. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
was so glad to get rid of ’em that they lent
’em anything they wanted.”</p>

<p>“Pies an’ cakes?”</p>

<p>“No!” said Budge, contemptuously. “You
don’t s’pose folks that’s goin’ off travelin’ for
forty years is goin’ to think ’bout eatin’ first
thing, do you? They borrowed clothes, an’
money, an’ everything else they could get, an’
left the Egyptians awful poor. An’ off they
started.”</p>

<p>“Did they have a ’cursion train?”</p>

<p>“No! All the excursion trains in the
world couldn’t have held such lots of people.
They rode on camels and donkeys, but lots of
’em walked.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that was a bit of fun.”</p>

<p>“You would have,” said Budge, “if you’d
always had to work like everything. Don’t
you ’member how once when mamma made
you work, an’ carry away all the blocks you
brought up on the piazza from the new
buildin’? You walked ’way off to the village
to get rid of it.”</p>

<p>“Ye&mdash;es,” drawled Toddie, “but I knew
I’d be rided back when dey came to look for
me. Den what did they do?”</p>

<p>“They started to travel to a nice country
that the Lord had told Moses about, an’ they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
got along till they came to a pretty big ocean
where there wasn’t any ferry-boats. I don’t
see what Moses took ’em to such a place as
that for, unless the Lord wanted to show ’em
that no ferry-boats could get the best of Him,
when all of a sudden they saw an awful lot of
dust bein’ kicked up behind ’em, an’ somebody
said that Pharaoh was a-comin’.”</p>

<p>“Should fink he’d seen ’nough of ’em,”
said Toddie. “Did he come down to the
boat to wave his hanafitch good-by at ’em?”</p>

<p>“No, he knew there wasn’t any boats
there, an’ so he came to take ’em back again
an’ make ’em work some more.”</p>

<p>“Should fink he’d be afraid de Lord would
kill him next.”</p>

<p>“P’r’aps he did; but then, you see, he was
awful lazy, an’ didn’t like to work for himself;
papa says there’s lots of folks that would
rather be killed than do any work.”</p>

<p>“Den what d’s de lazy folks do? They
can’t catch any Izzyrelites, can they?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Budge, “but they can do what
the Izzyrelites done themselves&mdash;they borrow
other people’s money. Well, when the
folks saw that ’twas Pharaoh a-comin’, they
began to grunt, an pitch into poor Moses, an’
told him he ought to be ashamed of hisself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
to bring ’em away off there to be killed, when
they might have died in Egypt without havin’
to walk so far. But Moses said: ‘Shut your
mouth, will you? The Lord’s doin’ this job.’
Then the Lord said: ‘Moses, lift up your cane
an’ point across the water with it!’s An’ the
minute Moses done that, the water of that
ocean went way up on one side, and way up
on the other side&mdash;just like it does in the
bathtub sometimes when we’re splashin’, you
know&mdash;and there was a path right through
the bottom of that ocean. An’ the people just
skooted right along it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>“Did they put on their rubbers fyst?
’Cause if they didn’t there must have been lots
of little boys spanked when they got across
for gettin’ their shoes muddy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Budge, after
a slight pause for reflection. “I must ’member
to ask papa about that. But when they all
got over they began to grumble some more, for
along came Pharaoh’s army right after ’em.”</p>

<p>“I fink they was a lot of good-for-nothing
cry-babies,” Toddie exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Budge. “I guess you’d
have yowled if you’d have been trudgin’
along through the mud ever so long, an’ then
seen some soldiers an’ chariots an’ spears an’
bows an’ arrows comin’ to kill you. But the
Lord knew just how to manage. He always
did. Papa says He always comes in when
you think He can’t. He said to Moses, ‘Lift
up your cane an’ point it across the ocean
again.’s An’ Moses done it, an’ down came
that big fence of water on both sides kerswosh!
An’ it drownded old Pharaoh an’
the whole good-for-nothin’ lot.”</p>

<p>“Then did the Izzyrelites go to cryin’ some
more?”</p>

<p>“Not much! They all got together an’
had a big sing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>“I know what they sung,” said Toddie.
“They all sung ‘TurnbackPharo’army-hallelujah.’”</p>

<p>“No, they didn’t,” said Budge. “They
sung that splendid thing mamma sings sometimes,
‘Sound the&mdash;loud tim&mdash;brel o’er&mdash;Egypt’&mdash;Egypt’
dark&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>Budge had with great difficulty repeated
the line of the glorious old anthem, then he
broke down and burst out crying.</p>

<p>“What’s you cryin’ about?” asked Toddie.
“Is you playin’ you’s an Izzyrelite?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Budge; “but whenever I think
about that song, somethin’ comes up in my
throat and makes me cry.”</p>

<p>The door of the room flew open, there was
a rustle and a hurried tread, and Mrs. Burton,
her face full of tears, snatched Budge to her
breast, and kissed him repeatedly, while
Toddie remarked:</p>

<p>“When fings come up in my froat I just
fwallows ’em.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton conducted her nephews to the
parlor floor, and said:</p>

<p>“Now, little boys, it’s nearly lunch time,
and I am going to have you nicely washed
and dressed, so that if any one comes in you
will look like little gentlemen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<p>“Ain’t we to be punished any more for
bein’ bad?” asked Budge.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Burton, kindly; “I’m
going to trust you to remember and be
good.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t what bothers me,” said Budge;
“I told a great, long Bible story to Tod up-stairs,
so’s to be like big folks when they get
bad, as much as I could. But Tod didn’t tell
any; I don’t think he’s got his punish.”</p>

<p>“He may tell his to-night, after Uncle
Harry gets home,” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“An’ sit in a chair in the corner of the up-stairs
room?” asked Budge.</p>

<p>“I hardly think that will be necessary this
time,” answered the lady.</p>

<p>“Then I don’t think you punish fair a bit,”
said Budge, with an aggrieved pout.</p>

<p>“I’ll be dzust as sad as I can ’bout it,
Budgie,” said Toddie, with a brotherly kiss.</p>

<p>The boys were led off by the chambermaid
to be dressed and Mrs. Burton seated herself
and devoted herself to earnest thought.
Time was flying, her husband had been between
dark and breakfast-time most exasperatingly
solicitous as to the success of his
wife’s theories of government, and not even
her genius of self-defense had prevailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
against him. She felt that so far she had
been steadily vanquished. Her husband
had told her in other days that it was always
so with the best generals in their first engagements,
so she determined that if men
had snatched victory from the jaws of defeat,
she should be able to do so as well. Her
desperation at the thought of a long lifetime
of “I told you so’” from her husband made
her determine that no discomfort should prevent
the most earnest endeavor for success.</p>

<p>The luncheon bell aroused her from what
had become a reverie in the valley of humiliation,
and she found awaiting her at the table
her nephews&mdash;Budge in a jaunty sailor-suit
and Toddie in a clean dress and an immaculate
white apron. An old experience caused
her to promptly end some researches of Toddie’,
instituted to discover whether his aunt’
dishes were really “turtle-pyates,” and an
attempt by Budge to drop oysters in the
mouth of the dog Terry, as he had seen his
uncle do with bread-crusts in the morning,
was forcibly brought to a close. Beyond the
efforts alluded to, the children did nothing
worse than people in good society often do at
table. After luncheon, Mrs. Burton said:</p>

<p>“Now, boys, this is Aunt Alice’s reception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>day.
I will probably have several calls, and
every one will want to know about that dear
little new baby, and you must be there to tell
them. So you must keep yourselves very
neat and clean. I know you wouldn’t like to
see any dirty people in my parlor!”</p>

<p>“Hatesh to shtay in parlors,” said Toddie.
“Wantsh to go and get some jacks” (“Jack-in-the-pulpit”&mdash;a
swamp plant).</p>

<p>“Not to-day,” said Mrs. Burton, kindly,
but firmly. “No one with nice white aprons
ever goes for jacks. What would you think
if you saw me in a swampy, muddy place,
with a nice white apron on, hunting for
jacks!”</p>

<p>“Why, I’d fink you could bring home
more’n me, ’cause your apron would hold the
mosht,” Toddie replied.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what,” said Budge, calling
Toddie into a corner and whispering earnestly
to him. The purity of Budge’s expression of
countenance and the tender shyness with
which he avoided her gaze when he noticed
that it was upon him, caused Mrs. Burton to
instinctively turn her head away, out of respect
for what she believed to be a childish
secret of some very tender order. Glancing
at the couple again for only a second, she saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
that Toddie, too, seemed rather less matter-of-fact
than usual. Finally both boys started
out of the doorway, Budge turning and remarking
with inflections simply angelic:</p>

<p>“Will be back pretty soon, Aunt Alice.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton proceeded to dress; she idly
touched her piano, until one lady after another
called, and occupied her time. Suddenly,
while trying to form a good impression on a
very dignified lady of the old school, both
boys marched into the parlor from the dining-room.
Mrs. Burton motioned them violently
away, for Budge’s trousers and Toddie’
apron were as dirty as they well could be.
Neither boy saw the visitor, however, for she
was hidden by one of the wings which held
the folding-doors, so both tramped up to their
aunt, while Budge exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Folks don’t go to heaven the second day,
anyhow, for we just dug up the bird to see,
an’ he was there just the same.”</p>

<p>“And dere wazh lots of little ants dere wiv
him,” said Toddie. “Is dat ’cause dey want
to got to hebben, too, an’ wantsh somebody
wif wings to help ’em up?”</p>

<p>“Budge!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton, in chilling
tones; “how did all this dirt come on your
clothes?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<p>“Why, you see,” said the boy, edging up
confidentially to his aunt, and resting his
elbows on her knee as he looked up into her
face, “I couldn’t bear to put the dear little
birdie in the ground again without sayin’
another little prayer. And I forgot to brush
my knees off.”</p>

<p>“Toddie,” said Mrs. Burton, “you couldn’t
have knelt down with your stomach and
breast. How did you get your nice white
apron so dirty?”</p>

<p>Toddie looked at the apron and then at
his aunt&mdash;looked at a picture or two, and
then at the piano&mdash;followed the cornice-line
with his eye, seemed suddenly to find what
he was looking for, and replied:</p>

<p>“Do you fink dat apron’s dyty? Well, I
don’t. Tell you watsh de matter wif it&mdash;I
fink de white’s gropped off.”</p>

<p>“Go into the kitchen!” Mrs. Burton commanded,
and both boys departed with heavy
pouts where pretty lips should have been.
Half an hour later their uncle, who had come
home early with the laudable desire of meeting
some of his wife’s acquaintances, found
his nephew Toddy upon the scaffolding of an
unfinished residence half-way between his
own residence and the railway station. Re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>membering
the story, dear to all makers of
school reading-books, of the boy whose sailor
father saw him perched upon the mainyard,
Mr. Burton stood beneath the scaffolding and
shouted to Toddie:</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p066.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“JUMP!” SHOUTED MR. BURTON</div>
</div>

<p>“Jump!”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” screamed Toddie.</p>

<p>“Jump!” shouted Mr. Burton, with increased
energy.</p>

<p>“Tell you I can’t,” repeated Toddie.
“Wezh playin’ Tower of Babel, an’ hazh had
our talks made different like de folks did
den, an’ when I tells Budge to bring buicksh,
he only buingzh mortar, an’ when I wantsh
mortar he buings buicksh. An’ den we talksh
like you an’ Aunt Alice did yestuday at de
table.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Budge, appearing from the inside
of the building with an armful of blocks.
“Just listen.” And the young man chattered
for a moment or two in a dialect never
even dimly hinted at except by a convention
of monkeys.</p>

<p>Mr. Burton cautiously climbed the ladder,
brought down one boy at a time, kissed
them both and shook them soundly, after
which the three wended homeward, the boys
having sawdust on every portion of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
clothes not already soiled by dirt, and most
of Mrs. Burton’s callers meeting the party
<i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Burton found his wife brilliantly conversational,
yet averse to talking about her
nephews. The exercise which they had been
compelled to take in their emulation of the
architects of the incomplete building on the
plain of Shinar gave them excellent appetites
and silenced tongues; but after his capacity
had been tested to the uttermost Budge said:</p>

<p>“It’s time for Tod to do his punishment
now, Aunt Alice. Don’t you know?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton winked at her husband, and
nodded approvingly to Budge.</p>

<p>“Come, Tod,” said Budge, “you must tell
your awful sad story now, an’ feel bad.”</p>

<p>“Guesh I’ll tell ’bout Peter Gray,” said
Toddie; “thatsh awful sad.”</p>

<p>“Who was Peter Gray?” asked Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“He’s a dzentleman dat a dyty little boy
in the nexsht street to us sings ’bout,” said
Toddie, “only I don’t sing ’bout him&mdash;I only
tellsh it. It’s dzust as sad that-a-way.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Budge.</p>

<p>“Once was a man,” said Toddie, with
great solemnity, “an’ his name was Peter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
Gray. An’ he loved a lady. An’ he says to
her papa, ‘I wantsh to marry your little gyle.’
An’ what you fink dat papa said? He said,
‘No!’” (this with great emphasis). “That
izhn’t as hard as he said it, eiver, but it’s azh
hard as I can say it. It’s puffikly dzedful
when Jimmy sings it. An’ Peter Gray felt
awful bad den, an’ he went out Wesht, to buy
de shkinzh dat comes off of animals an’ fings,
dough how dat made him feel nicer Jimmy
don’t sing ’bout. An’ bad Injuns caught
him an’ pulled his hair off, djust like ladies
pull deirsh off sometimezh. An’ when dat
lady heard ’bout it, it made her feel so bad
dat she went to bed an’ died. Datsh all.
Uncle Harry, ain’t you got to be punished
for somefin’, so you can tell ush a story?”</p>

<p>“It’s time little boys were in bed now,”
said Mrs. Burton, arising and taking Toddie
in her arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” said Budge. “I wish I was a
little boy in China, an’ just gettin’ up.”</p>

<p>“So does I,” said Toddie; “’cause den you
would have a tay-al on your head an’ I could
pull it!”</p>

<p>The boys retired, and Mrs. Burton broke
her reticence so far as to tell her husband the
story she had heard in the morning, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
insist that he was to arise early enough in the
morning to unearth the buried bird and
throw it away.</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly dreadful,” said she, “that
those children should be encouraged in making
trifling applications of great truths, and
I am determined, as far as possible, to prevent
the effects by removing the causes.”</p>

<p>And her husband put on an exasperating
smile and shook his head profoundly.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>The sun of the next morning arose at the
outrageously unfashionable hour that
he affects in June, but Mrs. Burton was up
before him. Her husband had attended a
town meeting the night before, and the forefathers
of the hamlet had been so voluble
that Mr. Burton had not returned home until
nearly midnight. He needed rest, and his
wife determined that he should sleep as long
as possible; but there were things dearer to
her than even the comfort of her husband,
and among these were the traditions she had
received concerning things mystical. She
had an intuition that her nephews would examine
the grave of the bird they had interred
two days before, and she dreaded to listen to
the literal conversation and comments that
would surely follow. Had the bird been a
human being, the remarks of its tender-hearted
little friends would have seemed anything
but materialistic to Mrs. Burton; but
it was only a bird, and the lady realized that
to answer questions as to the soullessness of
an innocent being and the comparative value<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
of characterless men and women was going
to be no easy task.</p>

<p>She therefore perfected a plan which should
be fair to all concerned; she would arouse her
husband only when she heard her nephews
moving; then she would engage the young
men in conversation while her husband desecrated
the grave. She would have saved considerable
trouble by locking the young men in
their chamber and allowing her husband to
slumber content, but having failed to remove
the key on the advent of the boys they had
found use for it themselves, and no questioning
had been able to discover its whereabouts.
Meanwhile the boys were quiet, and Mrs.
Burton devoted the peaceful moments to laying
out the day in such a manner as to have
the least possible trouble from her nephews.</p>

<p>A violent kicking at the front door and
some vigorous rings of the bell aroused the
lady from her meditation and her husband
from his dreams, while the dog Terry, who
usually slept on the inner mat at the front
door, began to howl piteously.</p>

<p>“Goodness!” growled Mr. Burton, rubbing
his eyes, as his wife pulled the bell-cord leading
to the servants’s room. “To whom do we
owe money?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’m afraid Helen is worse, or the
baby is poorly!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton,
opening the chamber-window, and shouting,
“Who is there?”</p>

<p>“Me,” answered a voice easily recognizable
as that of Budge.</p>

<p>“Me, too!” screamed a thinner but equally
familiar voice.</p>

<p>“We’ve got somethin’ awful lovely to tell
you, Aunt Alice,” shouted Budge. “Let us
in, quick!”</p>

<p>“Lovelier dan cake or pie or candy!”
screamed Toddie.</p>

<p>One of the servants hurried down the stairs,
the door opened, light footsteps hurried up
the steps, and the dog Terry, pausing for no
morning caress from his master, hurried under
the bed for refuge, from which locality he
expressed his apprehension in a dismal falsetto.
Then, with a tramp which only children
can execute, and which horses cannot
approach in noisiness, came Budge and
Toddie. Arrived at their aunt’s chamber-door,
each boy tried to push the other away,
that he might himself tell the story of which
both were full. At last, from the outer side
of the door:</p>

<p>“Dear little bydie’s gone to hebben.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Budge, “the angels took him
away.”</p>

<p>“An’ de little ants all went to hebben wif
him,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“Only the angels didn’t take the gravestone,
too,” said Budge. “Say, Aunt Alice,
what’s the use of gravestones after folks is
gone to heaven?”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Toddie. “I fought everybody
knowed dat; it’s so’s folks know where
to plant lovely flowers for deir angel what was
in the grave to look down at.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Budge, with the air of a
champion of a newly discovered doctrine,
“I’m just goin’ to ask papa who the folks are
that don’t believe deaders go to heaven. I’ll
jist tell ’em what geese they are.”</p>

<p>“Angels is dzust like birdies, isn’t they,
Aunt Alice?” Toddie asked. “’Cause dey’
got winghs an’ clawshes, too.”</p>

<p>“How do you know they have claws?”
asked Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“’Cause I saw deir scratch-holes in the
dyte at the grave,” said Toddie. “Dey was
dzust little bits of scratchy cracks like little
bydies make. I guesh dey was little baby-angels.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton winked at his wife, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
looking greatly mystified, and he uttered the
single monosyllable:</p>

<p>“Cats.”</p>

<p>“How did you get out of the house, children?”
Mr. Burton asked.</p>

<p>“Jumped out of one of the kitchen windows,”
said Budge. “But it was so high
from the ground that we couldn’t get in again
that way. And I think it’s breakfast-time;
we’ve been up ’bout two hours.”</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/p075.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“CATS,” UTTERED MR. BURTON</div>
</div>

<p>“Now’s the time for orthodox teaching, my dear,” suggested Mr.
Burton. “Physiologists say that the mind is more active when the
stomach’s empty.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mrs. Burton, starting
for the kitchen, “but the minds of those boys
are too active, even on full stomachs.”</p>

<p>Breakfast was on the table in due time,
and the boys showed appreciation of it.
After they were partly satisfied, however,
Budge asked:</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice, how much longer do you sup<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>pose
we can live without seeing that dear
little sister?”</p>

<p>“Dear little girl sister,” said Toddie, by
way of correction.</p>

<p>“Oh, quite a while,” Mrs. Burton replied.
“I know you love it and your mamma too
much to make either of them any trouble,
and both of them are quite feeble yet. You
love them better than you love yourself,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Budge. “That’s why I
want to see ’em so awful much.”</p>

<p>“I fink it’s awful mean for little sishterzh
not to have deir budders to play wif,” said
Toddie.</p>

<p>“Well, I will think about it, and if you will
both be very good, we will go there to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Budge. “We’ll be our very
goodest. I’ll tell you what, Tod; we’ll have
a Sunday-school right after breakbux; that’ll
be good.”</p>

<p>“I know something gooder dan that,” said
Toddie. “We’ll play Daniel in de lions’s den,
and you be de king an’ take me out. Dat’
a good deal gooder dan dzust playin’ Sunday-school;
’caush takin’ folks away from awful
bitey lions is a gooder fing dan dzust singin’
an’ prayin’, like they do in Sunday-school.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p>“Another frightful fit of heterodoxy to be
overcome, my dear,” observed Mr. Burton.
“That dreadful child is committed to the
doctrine of the superior efficacy of works
over faith.”</p>

<p>“I shall tell him the story of Daniel correctly,”
said Mrs. Burton, “and error will be
sure to fly from the appearance of truth.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton took his departure for the day,
and while his wife busied herself in household
management, the children discussed the etiquette
of the promised visit.</p>

<p>“Tell you what, Tod,” said Budge, “we
ought to take her presents, anyhow. That
was one of the lovaly things about Jesus being
a little baby once. You know those
shepherds came an’ brought him lots of
presents.”</p>

<p>“What letsh take her?” asked Toddie.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Budge, “the shepherds carried
money and things that smelled sweet, so
I guess that’s what we ought to do.”</p>

<p>“Aw wight,” said Toddie. “’Cept, houzh
we goin’ to get ’em?”</p>

<p>“We can go into the house very softly
when we get home, you know,” said Budge,
“an’ shake some pennies out of our savings-bank;
them’ll do for the money. Then for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
things that smell sweet we can get flowers
out of the garden.”</p>

<p>“Dat’ll be dzust a-givin’ her fings that’s at
home already. I fink ’twould be nicer to
carry her somefin’ from here, just as if we was
comin’ from where we took care of de sheep.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what,” said Budge. “Let’
tease Aunt Alice for pennies. We ought to
have thought about it before Uncle Harry
went away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” said Toddie. “An’ dere’s a
bottle of smelly stuff in Aunt Alice’s room;
we’ll get some of dat. Shall we ask her for
it, or dzust make b’lieve it’s ours?”</p>

<p>“Let’s be honest ’bout it,” said Budge.
“It’s wicked to hook things.”</p>

<p>“’Twouldn’t be hookin’ if we took it for
dat lovaly little sister baby, would it?” asked
Toddie. “’Sides, I want to s’prise Aunt
Alice an’ everybody wif de lots of presentsh
I makesh to de dear little fing.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ll tell you what,” said Budge, forgetting
the presents entirely in his rapture
over a new idea. “You know how bright the
point of the new lightning-rod on our house
is? Well, we’ll make b’lieve that’s the star
in the East, an’ it’s showin’ us where to come
to find the baby.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” exclaimed Toddie. “An’ maybe
Aunt Alice’ll carry us on her back, and
then we’ll make b’lieve we’re ridin’ camels,
like the shepherds in the picture we had
Christmas, an’ tore up to make menageries
of.”</p>

<p>The appearance of a large grasshopper
directly in front of the boys ended the conversation
temporarily, for both started in
chase of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p079.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">BOTH STARTED IN CHASE OF IT</div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p>Half an hour later both boys straggled into
the house, panting and dusty, and flung
themselves upon the floor, when their aunt,
with that weakness peculiar to the woman
who is not also a mother, asked them where
they had been, why they were out of breath,
how they came by so much dust on their
clothes, and why they were so cross. Budge
replied, with a heavy sigh:</p>

<p>“Big folks don’t know much about little
folks’s troubles.”</p>

<p>“Bad old hoppergrass, just kept a-goin’
wherever he wanted to, an’ never comed under
my hat,” complained Toddie.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he knew it would not be best for
you to have him, Toddie,” said Mrs. Burton.
“What would you have done with him if you
had succeeded in catching him?”</p>

<p>“Tookted his hind hoppers off,” said Toddie,
promptly.</p>

<p>“How dreadful!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton.
“What would you have done that for?”</p>

<p>“So’s he’d fly,” said Toddie. “The idea
of anybody wif wings goin’ awound on their
hoppersh! How’d you like it if I had wings,
an’ only trotted and jumped instead of flied?”</p>

<p>“My dear little boy,” said Mrs. Burton,
taking her nephew on her lap, “you must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
know that it’s very wrong to hurt animals in
that way. They are just as the Lord made
them, and just as he wants them to be.”</p>

<p>“All animals?” asked Toddie.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” answered Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Then what for doesh you catch pitty little
mices in traps an’ kill ’em?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton hastened to give the conversation
a new direction.</p>

<p>“Because they’re very troublesome,” she
said. “And even troublesome people have
to be punished when they meddle with other
people’s things.”</p>

<p>“We know that, I guess,” interposed
Budge, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“But,” said Mrs. Burton, hurrying forward
to her point, “the animals have nerves and
flesh and blood and bones, just like little boys
do, and are just the way the Lord made them.”</p>

<p>“I’ll look for the hoppergrass’s blood next
time I pull one’s legsh off,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“Don’t,” said Mrs. Burton. “You must
believe what aunty tells you, and you mustn’t
trouble the poor things at all. Why, Toddie,
there are real smart men, real good men that
everybody respects, that have spent their
whole lives in study of insects, like grasshoppers,
and flies, and bees&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>“An’ never got stung?” asked Toddie.
“How did dey do it?”</p>

<p>“They don’t care if they are stung,” said
Mrs. Burton. “They are deeply interested
in learning how animals are made. They
study all kinds of animals, and try to find out
why they are different from people; and they
find out that some wee things, like grasshoppers,
are more wonderful than any person
that ever lived!”</p>

<p>“I should think so,” said Budge. “If I
could hop like a grasshopper, I could jump
faster than any boy in the kindergarten, an’
if I could sting like a hornet, I could wallop
any boy in town.”</p>

<p>“Does they adzamine big animals, too?”
asked Toddie.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Burton. “One of them
has been away out West among the dreadful
Indians, just to find out what horses were
like a good many years ago.”</p>

<p>“If I find out all ’bout horsesh,” said Toddie,
“will everybody like me?”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Then I’m goin’ to,” said Toddie, sliding
out of his aunt’s lap.</p>

<p>“Never mind about it now, dear,” said
Mrs. Burton. “We are going to see mamma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
and baby now. Go and dress yourselves
neatly, boys.”</p>

<p>Both children started, and Mrs. Burton,
who was already prepared for her trip, opened
a novel, first giving herself credit for having
turned at least one perverted faculty of
Toddie’s into its heaven-ordained channel.</p>

<p>“Another triumph to report to my husband,”
said she, with a fine air of exultation,
as she opened her novel. “And yet,” she
continued, absent-mindedly, laying the book
down again, “I believe I have found no occasion
on which to report yesterday’s victories!”</p>

<p>The boys were slow to appear; but when
they came down-stairs they presented so
creditable an appearance as to call for a special
compliment from their aunt. On their
way to their mamma’s house they seemed
preoccupied, and they sought frequent occasions
to whisper to each other.</p>

<p>Arrived at home, their impatience knew no
restraint; and when the nurse appeared with
a wee bundle, topped with a little face, and
lying on a big pillow, both boys pounced upon
it at once, Budge trying to crowd several
pennies into the baby’s rose-leaves of hands,
while Toddie held to its nose a bottle labeled
“Liquid Bluing.” At the same time the baby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
sneezed alarmingly and a strong odor of
camphor pervaded the room.</p>

<p>“Where can that camphor be?” asked the
nurse. “There is nothing that Mrs. Lawrence
hates so intensely!”</p>

<p>The baby stopped sneezing and began a
pitiful wail, while Toddie hastened to pick up
the bluing-bottle; then the nurse saw that
upon the baby’s hitherto immaculate wraps
there was a large stain of a light-blue tint
and emitting a strong odor of camphor.
Meanwhile, Toddie had dragged upon his
aunt’s sack, held his precious bottle up to
his aunt’s nose, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Izhn’t dat too baddy! Baby gropped it,
and spilled mosht every bit of it on her
c’ozhes an’ on de floor!”</p>

<p>“Where did you get that camphor, Toddie?”
asked Mrs. Burton, “and why did you
bring it here?”</p>

<p>“Tizhn’t campiffer,” said Toddie. “It’
pyfume; I got it out of a big bottle on your
bureau, where you makes your hankafusses
smell sweet at. Budgie an’ me done dzust
what dem sheepmen did when dey came to
Beflehem to see de dear little Jesus-baby:
we brought our baby money an’ fings dat
smelled sweet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Burton kissed Toddie; then the nurse
fell on the floor and displayed the baby’s face,
and then the face was shadowed from the
light, and baby opened two little eyes and
regarded her brothers with a stare of queenly
gravity and gentleness, and the adoration
expressed by the faces of the two boys was
such as no old master ever put into the faces
in an “Adoration of the Magi,” and above
them bent a face more mature but none the
less suffused with tender awe. The silence
seemed too holy and delightful to be broken,
but Toddie soon looked up inquiringly into
his aunt’s face and asked:</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice, why don’t dere be a lovely
sun around her head like dere is in pictures
of dear little Jesus-babies?”</p>

<p>The quartet became human again, and the
nurse offered each of the party a five-minute
interview with the mother. Mrs. Burton
emerged from the sick-chamber with a face
which her nephews could not help scrutinizing
curiously; Budge came out with the remark
that he would never worry his sweet mamma
again while he lived, but Toddie exclaimed:</p>

<p>“If I had a little new baby I wouldn’t stay
in bed in dark roomsh all day long. I dzust
get up an’ dansh awound.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>“Aunt Alice,” asked Budge, on the way
back to his uncle’s residence, “now there’
somebody else at our house to have a birthday,
isn’t there? When will baby sister’
birthday come&mdash;how many days?”</p>

<p>“About three hundred and sixty,” said
Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Goodness!” exclaimed Budge. “And
how long ’fore Christmas’ll come again?”</p>

<p>“Nearly two hundred days.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think I will die if somebody don’t
have a birthday pretty soon, so I can give ’em
presents.”</p>

<p>“Why, you dear, generous little fellow,”
said Mrs. Burton, stooping to kiss him, “my
own birthday will come to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;h&mdash;h&mdash;h!” exclaimed Budge. “Say
Toddie&mdash;&mdash;” The remainder of the conversation
was conducted in whispers and
with countenances of extreme importance.
The boys even took a different road for home,
Budge explaining to his aunt that they had a
big secret to talk about.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton stopped <i>en route</i> to ask a
neighborly question or two, and arrived at
home somewhat later than her nephews.
She saw a horse and wagon at the door, and
rightly imagined that they belonged to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
grocer. But what a certain white mass on
the ground under the horse could consist of
Mrs. Burton was at a loss to conjecture, and
she quickened her pace only to find the white
substance aforesaid resolve itself into the
neatly clothed body of her nephew, Toddie,
who was lying on his back in the dirt, and
contemplating the noble animal’s chest with
serene curiosity.</p>

<p>There are moments in life when dignity
unbends in spite of itself, and grace of deportment
becomes a thing to be loathed.
Such a moment Mrs. Burton endured, as,
dropping her parasol, she cautiously but
firmly seized Toddie and snatched him from
his dangerous position.</p>

<p>“Go into the house, this instant, you dirty
boy!” said she, with an imperious stamp of
her foot.</p>

<p>The fear in Toddie’s countenance gave
place to expostulation, as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I was only dzust&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go into the house this instant!” repeated
Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;h&mdash;h&mdash;h!” said Toddie, beginning
to cry, and rolling out his under lip as freely
as if there were yards of it yet to come. “I
was only studyin’ how the horsie was made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
togevver, so’s everybody’d espec’s an’ love
me. Can’t go to where dem Injuns is, so I
fought a gushaway’s [grocery] man’ horsie
would be dzust as good. Ah&mdash;h&mdash;h!”</p>

<p>“There was no necessity for your lying on
the ground, in your clean piqué dress, to do
it,” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;h&mdash;h!” said Toddie again. “I studied
all de west of him fyst, an’ I couldn’t hold
him up so as to look under him. I tried to,
an’ he looked at me dweadful cwosh, an’ so
I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Go into the house and have another dress
put on,” said Mrs. Burton. “You know very
well that nothing excuses little boys for dirtying
their clothes when they can help it. When
your Uncle Harry comes home we shall have
to devise some way of punishing you so that
you may remember to take better care of
your clothing in the future.”</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;h&mdash;h&mdash;h&mdash;! I hope de Lord won’t
make any more horsesh, den, nor any little
boys to be told to find out about ’em, an’
be punnissed dzust for gettin’ deir c’oshes a
little dyty!” screamed Toddie, disappearing
through the doorway and filling the house
with angry screams.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton lingered for a moment upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
the piazza steps, and bravely endured a
spasm of sense. There forced itself upon her
mind the idea that it might be possible that
the soiling of garments was not the sin of all
sins, and that Toddie had really been affected
by her information about the noble origin
and nature of the animal physique. Certainly
nothing but a sincere passion for investigation
could have led Toddie between
the feet of a horse, and a person so absorbed
in scientific pursuits might possibly be excused
for being regardless of personal appearance.
But clean clothing ranked next
to clean hearts in the Mayton family, and
such acquirements as Mrs. Burton possessed
she determined to lovingly transmit to her
nephews, so far as was in her power. Toddie
seemed in earnest in his indignation, and she
respected mistaken impressions which were
honestly made, so she determined to try to
console the weeping child. Going into his
room, she found her nephew lying on his
back, kicking, screaming, and otherwise giving
vent to his rage.</p>

<p>“Toddie,” said Mrs. Burton, “it is too bad
that you should have so much trouble just
after you have been to see your mamma and
little sister.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p>“I know it!” screamed Toddie, “an’ you
can dzust go down-stairs again if dat’s all
you came to tell me.”</p>

<p>“But, Toddie, dear,” said Mrs. Burton,
kneeling and smoothing the hot forehead of
her nephew, “aunty wants to see you feeling
comfortable again.”</p>

<p>“Den put me back under the horsie again,
so folksh’ll ’espec’s me,” sobbed Toddie.</p>

<p>“You’ve learned enough about the horse
for to-day,” said Mrs. Burton. “I’ll ask
your papa to teach you more when you go
back home. Poor little boy, how hot your
cheeks are! Aunt Alice wishes she could see
you looking happy again.”</p>

<p>Toddie stopped crying for a moment,
looked at his aunt intently, sat up, put on
an air of importance, and said:</p>

<p>“Did de Lord send you up-stairsh to tell
me you was sorry for what you done to me?”
asked Toddie. “Den I forgives you, only
don’t do dat baddy way any more. If you
want to put a clean dwess on me, you can.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice,” said Budge, who had sauntered
into the room, “you told Uncle Harry
at the breakbux table that you was goin’ to
tell us about Daniel to-day. Don’t you
think it’s about time to do it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Toddie, hurrying his head
into his clean dress, “an’ how de lions et up
de bad men dat made de king frow Daniel
in de deep dark hole. Gwon.”</p>

<p>“There was a very good young man whose
name was Daniel,” said Mrs. Burton, “and
although the king made a law that nobody
should pray except to the gods that his people
worshiped, Daniel prayed every day to
the same Lord that we love.”</p>

<p>“He was up in heaven then, like he is
now, wasn’t he?” said Budge.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then where was the other people’s god?”</p>

<p>“Oh, on shelves and in closets, and all sorts
of places,” said Mrs. Burton. “They were
only bits of wood and stone; idols, in fact.”</p>

<p>“And wasn’t they good?”</p>

<p>“Not at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think that’s very nice, for
papa sometimes says that I am mamma’
idol. Am I sticky or stony?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, dear. He means that your
mother cares a great deal for you; that is all.
And Daniel prayed just as he chose and
when he chose, and the people that didn’t like
him hurried up the king and said, ‘Just see,
that young man for whom you care so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
is praying to the Lord that the Jews believe
in.’s The king was sorry to hear this, but
Daniel wouldn’t tell a lie; he admitted that
he prayed just as he wanted to, so the king
had to order some men to throw Daniel into
the den of lions. He felt very badly about
it, for Daniel had been always very good and
honest, and very good people are hard to find
anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Musht tell mamma dat, nexsht time she
saysh I must be very good,” said Toddie.
“Gwon.”</p>

<p>“They threw poor Daniel in among the
lions, and he must have felt dreadful on the
way to the den, for he knew that lions are
very savage and hungry. Why, one single
lion will often eat up a whole man, yet there
were a great many lions in the den Daniel
was taken to.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t make much of a supper for
all of them, poor fellow, would he?” Budge
asked.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p092.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT”</div>
</div>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Burton, “so he did what
sensible people always do when they find
themselves in trouble. He prayed. As for
the king, I imagine he didn’t sleep much that
night. People who take the advice of others
and against their own better judgment, gen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>erally
have to feel uncomfortable about it.
At any rate, the king was awake very early
next morning, and hurried off to the den
alone, and looked in, and shouted, ‘Daniel!
the Lord that you believe in, was he strong
enough to keep the lions from eating you?’
And then Daniel answered the king&mdash;think of
how happy it must have made the king to hear
his voice, and know he was not dead! The
unkindness of the king had not made Daniel
forget to be respectful, so he said, ‘Oh, king,
I hope you may live for ever.’s Then he told
the king that he had not been hurt at all, and
the king was very glad, and he had Daniel
taken out, and then the bad men who had
been the cause of Daniel being given to the
lions were all thrown into the den themselves,
and the lions ate every one of them.”</p>

<p>“I know why they let Daniel alone an’ ate
up all the other fellows,” said Budge, with an
air of comprehension.</p>

<p>“I felt sure you would, dear little boy,”
said Mrs. Burton; “but you may tell me
what you think about it.”</p>

<p>“Why, you see,” said Budge, “Daniel was
only one man, and he would be only a speck
apiece for all those lions&mdash;just like one single
bite of cake to a little boy. When there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
plenty of men, so that each lion could have
one for himself, they made up their minds
it was dinner-time, an’ so they went to
work.”</p>

<p>Somehow this reply caused Mrs. Burton to
forget to enforce the great moral application
of the story of Daniel, and she found it convenient
to make a sudden tour of inspection
in the kitchen. She was growing desperately
conscious that, instead of instructing and
controlling the children, she had thus far
done little but supply material for their active
minds and bodies to employ in manners
extremely distasteful to her. More than
once she found her mind wavering between
two extremes of the theories of government&mdash;it
seemed to her that she must either be
very severe, or must allow the children to
naturally develop their own faculties, within
reasonable bounds. At the first she rebelled,
partly because she was not cruel by nature,
as severe rulers of children often are, and
partly because the children were not her own.
The other extreme was equally distasteful,
however. Were not children always made
to mind in well-regulated families? To be
sure, they seldom in such cases fulfilled, in
adult years, the promise of their youth, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
that, of course, was their own fault&mdash;whose
else could it be? Should adults, should she,
whose will had never been brooked by parent
or husband, set aside her own inclinations for
the sake of a couple of unformed, unreasoning
minds?</p>

<p>Like most other people in doubt, Mrs. Burton
did nothing for a few hours and succeeded
thereby in entirely losing sight of her nephews
until nearly sunset, when, drawn by that instinct
which is strongest in the most immature
natures, the boys returned for something
to eat. Though quiet, there could be no
doubt about their contentment; their clothes
were very dirty, and so were their faces, but
out of the latter shone that indefinable something
that is the easily read indication of the
consciousness of rectitude and satisfaction
with the results of right-doing. They were
not communicative, even under much questioning,
and Mr. Burton finally said, as one in
a soliloquy:</p>

<p>“I wonder what it was?”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about, Harry?”
asked Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“I am merely wondering what original and
expensive experiment they’ve been up to
now,” replied the head of the household.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>“None whatever,” said Mrs. Burton, with
an energy almost startling. “I often wonder
how men can be so blind. Look at their
dear, pure little faces, dirty though they are;
there’s no more consciousness of wrong there
than there could be in an angel’s face.”</p>

<p>“Just so, my dear,” said Mr. Burton. “If
they were oftener conscious of misdeeds they
would be worse boys, but a great deal less
troublesome. Come see uncle, boys&mdash;don’t
you want a trot on my knees?”</p>

<p>Both children scrambled into their uncle’
arms, and Budge began to whisper very
earnestly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so,” Mr. Burton answered.</p>

<p>“Goody, goody, goody!” exclaimed Budge,
clapping his hands. “I’m going to give
you a birthday present to-morrow, Aunt
Alice.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“It’s something to eat,” said Budge.</p>

<p>“Mine, too,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“Be careful, Budge,” said Mr. Burton.
“You’ll let the secret out if you’re not careful.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I won’t. I only said ’twas something
to eat. But say, Aunt Alice, how do
bananas grow?” [said]
Toddie, with brightening eyes and a confident
shake of his curly head.</p>

<p>“And I know,” said Mr. Burton, lifting
Toddie suddenly from his knee, “that either
a certain little boy is breaking to pieces and
spilling badly, or something else is. What’
this?” he continued, noticing a very wet spot
on Toddie’s apron, just under which his
pocket was. “And” (here he opened Toddie’
pocket and looked into it) “what is that
vile muss in your pocket?”</p>

<p>Toddie’s eyes opened in wonder, and then
his countenance fell.</p>

<p>“’Twash only a little bunch,” said he, “an’
I was goin’ to eat it on de way home, but I
forgotted it!”</p>

<p>“They’re white grapes, my dear,” said
Mr. Burton. “The boys have been robbing
somebody’s hothouse; Tom has no
grapes in his. Where did you get these,
boys?”</p>

<p>“Sh&mdash;h&mdash;h!” whispered Toddie, impressively.
“Nobody musht never tell secretsh.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get those grapes?” demanded
Mrs. Burton, hastening to the examination
of the dripping dress.</p>

<p>Toddie burst into tears.</p>

<p>“I should think you would cry!” ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>claimed
Mrs. Burton; “after stealing people’
fruit.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t cryin’ ’bout dat,” sobbed Toddie.
“I’ze cryin’ ’caush youze a-spoilin’ my
s’prise for your bifeday ev’ry minute you’
a-talkin’!”</p>

<p>“Alice, Alice!” said Mr. Burton, softly.
“Remember that the poor child is not old
enough to have learned what stealing means.”</p>

<p>“Then he shall learn now!” exclaimed
Mrs. Burton, all of her righteous sense upon
the alert. “What do you suppose would become
of you if you were to die to-night?”</p>

<p>“Won’t die!” sobbed Toddie. “If angel
comes to kill me like he did the ’Gyptians,
I’ll hide.”</p>

<p>“No one could hide from the angel of the
Lord,” said Mrs. Burton, determined that
fear should do what reason could not.</p>

<p>“Why, he doesn’t carry no lanternzh wif
him in de night-time, does he?” said Toddie.</p>

<p>Mr. Burton laughed but his wife silenced
him with a glance and answered:</p>

<p>“He can see well enough to find bad little
boys when he wants them.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t bad,” screamed Toddie, “an’ I
won’t give you de uvver grapes now, dat we
brought home in a flower-pot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>“Come to uncle, old boy,” said Mr. Burton,
taking the doleful child upon his knee
again, and caressing him tenderly. “Tell
uncle all about it, and he’ll see if you can’t
be set all right.”</p>

<p>“An’ not

angel come
catch me?”
asked Toddie.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,
Uncle Harry,”
said Budge.
“We was goin’ to give Aunt Alice fruit for
her birthday&mdash;me bananas an’ Tod white
grapes. We didn’t know where any bananas
growed, but Mr. Bushman, way off along the
mountain, has got lots of lovely grapes in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
greenhouse, ’cause we went there once with
papa, and they talked ’bout grapes an’
things ’most all afternoon, an’ he told him to
come help himself whenever he wanted any.
So we made up a great secret, an’ we went
up there this afternoon to ask him to give us
some for our aunt, ’cause ’twas goin’ to be
her birthday. But he wasn’t home, and the
greenhouse man wasn’t there either; but the
door was open, an’ we went in an’ saw the
grapes, an’ we made up our minds that he
wouldn’t care if we took some, ’cause he told
papa to. So we got three or four nice bunches,
and put ’em in a flower-pot with leaves in
it, and each of us got a little bunch to eat
ourselves; but we found lots of wild strawberries
on the way back, so Tod forgot his
grapes, I guess, but mine’s safe in my stomach.
An’ ’twas awful hot an’ dusty, an’ I
never got so tired in my life. But we wanted
to make Aunt Alice happy, so we didn’t
care.”</p>

<p>“An’ then she said we was fiefs!” sobbed
Toddie. “Bad old fing!”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Toddie,” said Mrs. Burton,
all her moral purpose taking flight as she
kissed the tear-stained, dirty little cheeks,
and carried her nephew to the dinner-table.</p>

<div class="caption">“SO I PUTTED CROSSES ON THE DOOR”</div>
</div>


<p>Toddie’s meal was quickly dispatched. He
seemed preoccupied, and hurried away from
the table, though he was quite ready to go to
bed when summoned by his aunt. Half an
hour later Mr. Burton, sauntering out to the
piazza to smoke, saw a large, rude cross, in
red ink, on either side of the door-frame.
Even men have weaknesses, and a fastidiousness
about the appearance of his house was
one of Mr. Burton’. He dashed up the
stairs, three steps at a time, and burst into
his nephew’s room, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Who daubed the door with ink?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>

<p>“Me,” said Toddie, boldly. “I was afraid
you’d forget to tell dat killey angel I wasn’t
any fief, so I putted crosses on de door, like
de Izzyrelites did, so he would go a-past.
He wouldn’t know de ink wasn’t blood, I
guess, in de night-time.”</p>

<p>Toddie suddenly found himself alone again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton’s birthday dawned
brightly, and it is not surprising that
as it was her first natal anniversary since her
marriage to a man who had no intention or
ability to cease being a lover, her ante-breakfast
moments were too fully and happily occupied
to allow her to even think of two little
boys who had already impressed upon her
their willingness and general ability to think
for themselves. As for the boys themselves,
they woke with the lark, and with a heavy
sense of responsibility also. The room of
Mrs. Burton’s chambermaid joined their own,
and the occupant of that room having been
charged by her mistress with the general care
of the boys between dark and daylight, she
had grown accustomed to wake at the first
sound in the boys’s room. On the morning
of her mistress’s birthday the first sound she
heard was:</p>

<p>“Tod?”</p>

<p>No response could be heard; but a moment
later the chambermaid heard:</p>

<p>“T&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;od!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;h&mdash;h&mdash;ow!” drawled a voice, not so
sleepily but it could sound aggrieved.</p>

<p>“Wake up, dear old Toddie budder. It’
Aunt Alice’s birthday now.”</p>

<p>“Needn’t bweak my earzh open, if ’tis,”
whined Toddie.</p>

<p>“I only holloed in one ear, Tod,” remonstrated
Budge, “an’ you ought to love dear
Aunt Alice enough to have that hurt a little
rather than not wake up.”</p>

<p>A series of groans, snarls, whines, grunts,
snorts, and remonstrances semi-articulate
were heard, and at length some complicated
wriggles and convulsive kicks were made
manifest to the listening ear, and Budge
said:</p>

<p>“That’s right! Now let’s get up an’ get
ready. Say; do you know that we didn’t
think anything about having some music?
Don’t you remember how papa played the
piano last mamma’s birthday when she came
down-stairs, an’ how happy it made her, an’
we danced around?”</p>

<p>“Aw wight,” said Toddie. “Let’.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what,” said Budge. “Let’
both bang the piano, like mamma an’ Aunt
Alice does together sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yesh!” Toddie exclaimed. “We can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
make some awful big bangsh before she can
get down to tell us to don’t.”</p>

<p>Then there was heard a scurrying of light
feet as the boys picked up their various articles
of clothing from the corners, chairs,
bureau, table, etc., where they had been
tossed the night before. The chambermaid
hurried to their assistance, and both boys
were soon dressed. A plate containing bananas,
and another with the hard-earned
grapes, were on the bureau, and the boys
took them and tiptoed down the stair and
into the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Gwacious!” said Toddie, as he placed his
plate on the sideboard; “maybe the gwapes
an’ buttonanoes has got sour. I guesh we’d
better try ’em, like mamma does de milk on
hot morningsh when the baddy milkman
don’t come time enough.” Toddie suited
the action to the word by plucking from a
cluster the handsomest grape in sight. “I
fink,” said he, smacking his lips with the suspicious
air of a professional taster; “I fink
dey is gettin’ sour.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see,” said Budge.</p>

<p>“No,” said Toddie, plucking another
grape with one hand while with the other he
endeavored to cover his gift. “Ize bid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
enough to do it all myself. Unless,” he added,
as a happy inspiration struck him,
“you’ll let me help see if your buttonanoes
is sour.”</p>

<p>“Then you can only have one bite,” said
Budge. “You must let me taste about six
grapes, ’cause ’twould take that many to
make one of your bites on a banana.”</p>

<p>“Aw wight,” said Toddie; and the boys
proceeded to exchange duties, Budge taking
the precaution to hold the banana himself,
so that his brother should not abstractedly
sample a second time, and Toddie doling out
the grapes with careful count.</p>

<p>“They are a little sour,” said Budge, with
a wry face. “Perhaps some other bunch is
better. I think we’d better try each one,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“An’ each one of the buttonanoes, too,”
suggested Toddie. “Dat one wazh pretty
good, but maybe some of the others isn’t.”</p>

<p>The proposition was accepted, and soon
each banana had its length reduced by a
fourth, and the grape-clusters displayed a
fine development of wood. Then Budge
seemed to realize that his present was not
as sightly as it might be, for he carefully
closed the skins at the ends, and turned the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
unbroken ends to the front as deftly as if
he were a born retailer of fruit.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p107.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“THEN YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE BITE,” SAID BUDGE</div>
</div>

<p>This done, he exclaimed:
“Oh! we want
our cards on ’em, else
how will she know who
they came from?”</p>

<p>“We’ll be here to tell
her,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“Huh!” said Budge;
“that wouldn’t make
her half so happy. Don’t you know how
when cousin Florence gets presents of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
flowers, she’s always happiest when she’
lookin’ at the card that comes with ’em?”</p>

<p>“Aw wight,” said Toddie, hurrying into
the parlor, and returning with the cards of a
lady and gentleman, taken haphazard from
his aunt’s card-receiver.</p>

<p>“Now, we must write ‘Happy Birthday’
on the backs of ’em,” said Budge, exploring
his pockets, and extracting a stump of a lead
pencil. “Now,” continued Budge, leaning
over the card, and displaying all the facial
contortions of the unpractised writer, as he
laboriously printed, in large letters, speaking,
as he worked, a letter at a time:</p>

<p>“H&mdash;A&mdash;P&mdash;P&mdash;E B&mdash;U&mdash;R&mdash;F&mdash;D&mdash;A&mdash;Happy
Birthday. Now, you must hold
the pencil for yours, or else it won’t be so
sweet; that’s what mamma says.”</p>

<p>Toddie took the pencil in his pudgy hand,
Budge guided it, and two juvenile heads
touched each other and swayed and twisted
and bobbed in unison until the work was
completed.</p>

<p>“Now, I think she ought to come,” said
Budge. (Breakfast-time was still more than
an hour distant.) “Why, the rising-bell
hasn’t rung yet! Let’s ring it!”</p>

<p>The boys fought for possession of the bell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
but superior might conquered and Budge
marched up and down the hall, ringing with
the enthusiasm and duration peculiar to the
amateur.</p>

<p>“Bless me!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton, hastening
to complete her toilet. “How time
does fly&mdash;sometimes!”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton saw something in his wife’
face that called for lover-like treatment, but
it was not without a sense of injury that he
exclaimed, immediately after, as he drew
forth his watch:</p>

<p>“I declare! I would make an affidavit
that we hadn’t been awake half an hour.
Ah! I forgot to wind my watch last
night.”</p>

<p>The boys hurried into the parlor.</p>

<p>“I hear ’em trampin’ around!” exclaimed
Budge, in great excitement. “There!&mdash;the
piano’s shut! Isn’t that too mean? Oh,
I’ll tell you; here’s Uncle Harry’s violin.”</p>

<p>“But whatsh I goin’ to play on?” asked
Toddie, dancing frantically about.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said Budge, dropping
the violin, and hurrying to the floor above,
from which he speedily returned with a
comb. A bound volume of the <i>Portfolio</i> lay
upon the table, and opening this, Budge tore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
the tissue paper from one of the etchings and
wrapped the comb in it.</p>

<p>“There!” said he, “you fiddle an’ I’ll blow
the comb. Goodness! why don’t they come
down? Oh, we forgot to put pennies under
the plate, and we don’t know how many
years old to put ’em for.”</p>

<p>“An’ we ain’t got no pennies,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“I know,” said Budge, hurrying to a cabinet
in a drawer of which his uncle kept the
nucleus of a collection of American coinage.
“This kind of pennies,” Budge continued,
“isn’t as pretty as our kind, but they’re bigger,
an’ they’ll look better on a table-cloth.
Now, how old do you think she is?”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” said Toddie, going into a reverie
of hopeless conjecture. “She’s about as
big as you an’ me put togevver.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Budge, “you’re four an’ I’m
six, an’ four an’ six is ten&mdash;I guess ten’ll be
about the thing.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton’s plate was removed, and the
pennies were deposited in a circle. There
was some painful counting and recounting,
and many disagreements, additions and subtractions.
Finally, the pennies were arranged
in four rows, two of three each and
two of two each, and Budge counted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
threes and Toddie verified the twos, and
Budge was adding the four sums together,
when footsteps were heard descending the
stairs.</p>

<p>Budge hastily dropped the surplus coppers
upon the four rows, replaced the plate, and
seized the comb as Toddie placed the violin
against his knee as he had seen small, itinerant
Italians do. A second or two later, as
the host and hostess entered the dining-room,
there arose a sound which caused Mrs. Burton
to clap her fingers to her ears, while her
husband exclaimed:</p>

<p>“’Scat!”</p>

<p>Then both boys dropped their instruments,
Toddie finding the ways of his own feet seriously
compromised by the strings of the violin,
while both children turned happy faces
toward their aunt, and shouted:</p>

<p>“Happy Burfday!”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton hurried to the rescue of his
darling instrument, while his wife gave each
boy an appreciative kiss, and showed them a
couple of grateful tears. Her eye was caught
by the fruit on the sideboard, and she read
the cards aloud:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Frank Rommery&mdash;this is just like
her effusiveness. I’ve never met her but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
once, but I suppose her bananas must atone
for her lack of manners. Why, Charley
Crewne! Dear me! What memories some
men have!”</p>

<p>A cloud came upon Mr. Burton’s brow.
Charley Crewne had been one of his rivals for
Miss Mayton’s hand, and Mrs. Burton was
looking a trifle thoughtful, and her husband
was as unreasonable as newly made husbands
often are, when Mrs. Burton exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Some one has been picking the grapes off
in the most shameful manner. Boys!”</p>

<p>“Ain’t from no Rommerys an’ Crewnes!”
said Toddie. “Devsh from me an’ Budgie,
an’ we dzust tasted ’em to see if dey’d got
sour in the night.”</p>

<p>“Where did the cards come from?” asked
Mrs Burton.</p>

<p>“Out of the basket in the parlor,” said
Budge. “But the back is the nice part of
’em.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton’s thoughtful expression and
her husband’s frown disappeared together
as they seated themselves at the table. Both
boys wriggled vigorously until their aunt
raised her plate, and then Budge exclaimed:</p>

<p>“A penny for each year, you know.”</p>

<p>“Thirty-one!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
after counting the heap. “How complimentary!”</p>

<p>“What doesh you do for little boys on
your bifeday?” asked Toddie, after breakfast
was served. “Mamma does lots of
fings.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p113.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“WHERE DID THE CARDS COME FROM?”</div>
</div>

<p>“Yes,” said Budge, “she says she thinks
people ought to get their own happy by
makin’ other people happy. An’ mamma
knows better than you, you know, ’cause
she’s been married longest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>Although Mrs. Burton admitted the facts,
the inference seemed scarcely natural, and
she said so.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;anyhow,” said Toddie,
“mamma always has parties on her bifeday,
an’ we hazh all de cake we want.”</p>

<p>“You shall be happy to-day,” said Mrs.
Burton; “for a few friends will be in to see
me this afternoon, and I am going to have a
nice little luncheon for them, and you shall
lunch with us, if you will be very good until
then, and keep yourselves clean and neat.”</p>

<p>“Aw wight,” said Toddie. “Izhn’t it most
time now?”</p>

<p>“Tod’s all stomach,” said Budge. “Say,
Aunt Alice, I hope you won’t forget to have
some fruit-cake. That’s the kind we like
best.”</p>

<p>“You’ll come home very early, Harry?”
asked Mrs. Burton, ignoring her nephew’
question.</p>

<p>“By noon, at furthest,” said the gentleman.
“I only want to see my morning letters,
and fill any orders that may be in them.”</p>

<p>“What are you coming so early for, Uncle
Harry?” asked Budge.</p>

<p>“To take Aunt Alice riding, old boy,” said
Mr. Burton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<p>“Oh! just listen, Tod! Won’t that be
jolly? Uncle Harry’s going to take us riding!”</p>

<p>“I said I was going to take your Aunt
Alice, Budge,” said Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“I heard you,” said Budge, “but that
won’t trouble us any. She always likes to
talk to you better than she does to us.
Where are we going?”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton asked his wife, in German,
whether the Lawrence-Burton assurance
was not charmingly natural, and Mrs. Burton
answered in the same tongue that it was,
but was none the less deserving of rebuke,
and that she felt it her duty to tone it down
in her nephews. Mr. Burton wished her joy
of the attempt, and asked a number of
searching questions about success already attained,
until Mrs. Burton was glad to see
Toddie come out of a brown study and hear
him say:</p>

<p>“I fink dat placesh where de river is bwoke
off izh de nicest placesh.”</p>

<p>“What does the child mean?” asked his
aunt.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know where we went last year,
an’ you stopped us from seein’ how far we
could hang over, Uncle Harry?” said Budge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>“Oh! Passaic Falls!” exclaimed Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it,” said Budge.</p>

<p>“Old riverzh bwoke wight in two dere,”
said Toddie, “an’ a piece of it’s way up in de
air, an’ anuvver piece izh way down in big
hole in de stones. Datsh where I want to
go widin’.”</p>

<p>“Listen, Toddie,” said Mrs. Burton. “We
like to take you riding with us at most times,
but to-day we prefer to go alone. You and
Budge will stay at home. We sha’n’t be gone
more than two hours.”</p>

<p>“Wantsh to go a-widin’,” exclaimed Toddie.</p>

<p>“I know you do, dear, but you must wait
until some other day.”</p>

<p>“But I wantsh to go,” Toddie explained.</p>

<p>“And I don’t want you to, so you can’t,”
said Mrs. Burton in a tone which would reduce
any reasonable person to hopelessness.
But Toddie, in spite of manifest astonishment,
remarked:</p>

<p>“Wantsh to go a-widin’.”</p>

<p>“Now the fight is on,” murmured Mr. Burton
to himself. Then he arose hastily from
the table and said:</p>

<p>“I think I’ll try to catch the earlier train,
my dear, as I am coming back so soon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Burton arose to bid her husband
good-by, and was kissed with more than
usual tenderness, and then held at arm’
length, while manly eyes looked into her
own with an expression which she found untranslatable&mdash;for
two hours, at least. Mrs.
Burton saw her husband fairly on his way,
and then she returned to the dining-room,
led Toddie into the parlor, took him on her
lap, wound her arms tenderly about him,
and said:</p>

<p>“Toddie, dear, listen carefully to what
Aunt Alice tells you. There are some reasons
why you boys should not go with us
to-day, and Aunt Alice means what she says
when she tells you you can’t go with us. If
you were to ask a hundred times it would not
make the slightest bit of difference. You cannot
go, and you must stop thinking about it.”</p>

<p>Toddie listened intelligently from beginning
to end, and replied:</p>

<p>“But I wantsh to go.”</p>

<p>“And you can’t. That ends the matter.”</p>

<p>“No, it don’t,” said Toddie; “not a single
bittie. I wantsh to go badder dan ever.”</p>

<p>“But you are not going.”</p>

<p>“I wantsh to go so baddy,” said Toddie,
beginning to cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>“I suppose you do, and auntie is very
sorry for you, but that does not alter the
case. When grown people say ‘No!’ little
boys must understand that they mean it.”</p>

<p>“But what I wantsh izh to go a-widin’
wif you.”</p>

<p>“And what I want is, that you shall stay
at home; so you must. Let us have no more
talk about it now. Shouldn’t you like to go
into the garden and pick some strawberries
all for yourself?”</p>

<p>“No, I’d like to go widin’.”</p>

<p>“Toddie,” said Mrs. Burton, “don’t let me
hear one more word about riding.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want to go.”</p>

<p>“Toddie, I will have to punish you if you
say any more on this subject, and that will
make me very unhappy. You don’t want
to make auntie unhappy on her birthday,
do you?”</p>

<p>“No; but I do want to go a-widin’.”</p>

<p>“Listen, Toddie,” said Mrs. Burton, with
an imperious stamp of her foot, and a sudden
loss of her entire stock of patience. “If you
say one more word about that trip, I shall
lock you in the attic chamber, where you
were the day before yesterday, and Budge
shall not be with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p>Toddie gave vent to a torrent of tears, and
screamed:</p>

<p>“A&mdash;h&mdash;h&mdash;h! I don’t want to be locked
up, an’ I do want to go a-widin’!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p119.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">HE KICKED, PUSHED, SCREAMED AND ROARED</div>
</div>

<p>Toddie suddenly
found himself clasped
tightly in his aunt’
arms, in which
position he
kicked, pushed,
screamed and
roared during the passage of two flights of
stairs. The moment of his final incarceration
was marked by a piercing shriek which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
escaped from the attic-window, causing the
dog Terry to retire precipitately from a
pleasing lounging place on the well-curb, and
making a passing farmer to rein up his horses
and maintain a listening position for the
space of five minutes. Meanwhile Mrs. Burton
descended to the parlor, more flushed,
untidy and angry than any one had ever
seen her. She soon encountered the gaze of
her nephew Budge, and it was full of solemnity,
inquiry and reproach.</p>

<p>“How would you like to be carried up-stairs
screamin’ an’ put in a lonely room,
just ’cause you wanted to go ridin’?” Budge
asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton was unable to imagine herself
in any such position, but replied:</p>

<p>“I should never be so foolish as to keep on
wanting what I knew I could not have.”</p>

<p>“Why!” exclaimed Budge. “Are grown
folks as smart as all that?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton’s conscience smote her not
overlightly, and she hastened to change the
subject, and to devote herself assiduously to
Budge, as if to atone for some injury which
she might have done his brother. An occasional
howl which fell from the attic-window
increased her zeal for Budge’s comfort;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
under each one, however, her resolution
grew weaker, and, finally, with a hypocritical
excuse to Budge, she hurried up to the door
of Toddie’s prison and said through the keyhole:</p>

<p>“Toddie?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Will you be a good boy, now?”</p>

<p>“Yesh, if you’ll take me a-widin’.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton turned abruptly away, and
simply flew down the stairs. Budge, who
awaited her at the foot, instinctively stood
aside, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I thought you was goin’ to tumble! Why
didn’t you bring him down?”</p>

<p>“Bring who?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what you went up-stairs for,”
said Budge. “Your eyes told me all about
it.”</p>

<p>“You’re certainly a rather inconvenient
companion,” said Mrs. Burton, averting her
face, “and I want you to run home and ask
how your mamma and baby-sister are.
Don’t stay long: remember that luncheon
will be earlier than usual to-day.”</p>

<p>Away went Budge, and Mrs. Burton devoted
herself to thought. Unquestioning
obedience had been her own duty since she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
could remember, yet she was certain that her
will was as strong as Toddie’. If she had
been always able to obey, certainly the unhappy
little boy in the attic was equally capable;
why should he not do it? Perhaps, she
admitted to herself, she had inherited a faculty
in this direction, and perhaps&mdash;yes, certainly,
Toddie had done nothing of the sort.
How was she to overcome the defect in his
disposition; or was she to do it at all? Was
it not something with which no one temporarily
having a child in charge should
interfere?</p>

<p>An occasional scream from Toddie helped
to unbend the severity of her principles, but
suddenly her eye rested upon a picture of
her husband, and she seemed to see in one of
the eyes a quizzical expression. All her determination
came back in an instant with
heavy re-enforcements, and Budge came back
a few moments later. His bulletins from
home, and his stores of experiences <i>en route</i>
consumed but a few moments, and then Mrs.
Burton proceeded to dress for her ride. To
exclude Toddie’s screams she closed her door
tightly, but Toddie’s voice was one with
which all timber seemed in sympathy, and it
pierced door and window apparently without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
effort. Gradually, however, it seemed to
cease, and with the growing infrequency of
his howls and the increasing feebleness of
their utterance, Mrs. Burton’s spirits revived.
Dressing leisurely, she ascended to
Toddie’s prison to receive his declaration of
penitence and to accord a gracious pardon.
She knocked softly at the door and said:</p>

<p>“Toddie?”</p>

<p>There was no response, so Mrs. Burton
knocked and called with more energy than
before, but without reply. A terrible fear
occurred to her; she had heard of children
who screamed themselves to death when angry.
Hastily she opened the door, and saw
Toddie, tear-stained and dirty, lying on the
floor, fast asleep. She stooped over him to
be sure that he still breathed, and then the
expression on his sweetly parted lips was such
that she could not help kissing it. Then she
raised the pathetic, desolate little figure
softly in her arms, and the little head dropped
upon her shoulder and nestled close to
her, and one little arm was clasped tightly
around her neck, and a soft voice murmured:</p>

<p>“I wantsh to go a-widin’.”</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Burton entered, and, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
an exasperating affectation of ingenuousness
and uncertainty asked:</p>

<p>“Did you conquer his will, my dear?”</p>

<p>His wife annihilated him with a look, and
led the way to the dining-room; meanwhile,
Toddie awoke, straightened himself, rubbed
his eyes, recognized his uncle, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Uncle Harry, does you know where we’
goin’ dis afternoon? We’s goin’ a-widin’.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton hid in his napkin the half of
his face that was below his eyes, and his wife
wished that his eyes might have been hidden
too, for never in her life had she been so
averse to having her own eyes looked into.</p>

<p>The saintliness of both boys during the
afternoon’s ride took the sting out of Mrs.
Burton’s defeat. They gabbled to each other
about flowers and leaves and birds, and they
assumed ownership of the few summer clouds
that were visible, and made sundry exchanges
of them with each other. When the
dog Terry, who had surreptitiously followed
the carriage and grown weary, was taken in
by his master they even allowed him to lie
at their feet without kicking, pinching his
ears or pulling his tail.</p>

<div class="caption">THE JARDINIÈRE CAME DOWN WITH A CRASH</div>
</div>

<p>As for Mrs. Burton, no right-minded husband
could wilfully torment his wife upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
her birthday, so she soon forgot the humiliation
of the morning, and came home with
superb spirits and matchless complexion for
the little party. Her guests soon began to
arrive, and after the company had assembled
Mrs. Burton’s chambermaid ushered in
Budge and Toddie, each in spotless attire,
and the dog Terry ushered himself in, and
Toddie saw him and made haste to interview
him, and the two got inextricably mixed
about the legs of a light jardinière, and it
came down with a crash, and then the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
were sent into disgrace, which suited them
exactly, although there was a difference between
them as to whether the dog Terry
should seek and enjoy the seclusion upon
which his heart was evidently intent.</p>

<p>Then Budge retired with a face full of
brotherly solicitude, and Mrs. Burton was
enabled to devote herself to the friends to
whom she had not previously been able to
address two consecutive sentences.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton occasionally suggested to her
husband that it might be well to see where
the boys were and what they were doing, but
that gentleman had seldom before found himself
the only man among a dozen comely and
intelligent ladies, and he was too conscious
of the rarity of such experiences to trouble
himself about a couple of people who had unlimited
ability to keep themselves out of
sight, so the boys were undisturbed for the
space of two hours. A sudden summer
shower came up in the meantime, and a sentimental
young lady requested the song “The
Rain upon the Roof,” and Mrs. Burton and
her husband began to render it as a duet;
but in the middle of the second stanza Mrs.
Burton began to cough, and Mr. Burton
sniffed the air apprehensively, while several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
of the ladies started to their feet, while others
turned pale. The air of the room was evidently
filling with smoke.</p>

<p>“There can’t be any danger, ladies,” said
Mrs. Burton. “You all know what the
American domestic servant is. I suppose
our cook, with her delicate sense of the appropriate,
is relighting her fire, and has the
kitchen door wide open, so that all the smoke
may escape through the house instead of the
chimney. I’ll go and stop it.”</p>

<p>The mere mention of servants had its
usual effect; the ladies began at once that
animated conversation which this subject
has always inspired, and which it will probably
continue to inspire until all housekeepers
gather in that happy land, one of whose
charms it is that the American kitchen is
undiscernible within its borders, and the purified
domestic may stand before her mistress
without needing a scolding. But one nervous
young lady, whose agitation was being
manifested by her feet alone, happened to
touch with the toe of her boot the turn-screw
of a hot-air register. Instantly she sprang
back and uttered a piercing scream, while
from the register there arose a thick column
of smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<p>“Fire!” screamed one lady.</p>

<p>“Water!” shrieked another.</p>

<p>“Oh!” shouted several in chorus.</p>

<p>Some ran up-stairs, others into the rainy
street, the nervous young lady fainted, a
business-like young matron, who had for
years been maturing plans of operation in
case of fire, hastily swept into a table-cover
a dozen books in special morocco bindings,
and hurried through the rain with them to a
house several hundred feet away, while the
faithful dog Terry, scenting the trouble afar
off, hurried home and did his duty to the
best of his ability by barking and snapping
furiously at every one, and galloping frantically
through the house, leaving his mark
upon almost every square yard of carpet.
Meanwhile Mr. Burton hurried up-stairs
coatless, with disarranged hair, dirty hands,
smirched face, and assured the ladies that
there was no danger, while Budge and Toddie,
the former deadly pale, and the latter
almost apoplectic in color, sneaked up to their
own chamber.</p>

<p>The company dispersed; ladies who had
expected carriages did not wait for them,
but struggled to the extreme verge of politeness
for the use of such umbrellas and water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>proof
cloaks as Mrs. Burton could supply.
Fifteen minutes later the only occupant of
the parlor was the dog Terry, who lay, with
alert head, in the centre of a large Turkish
chair. Mrs. Burton, tenderly supported by
her husband, descended the stair, and contemplated
with tightly compressed lips and
blazing eyes the disorder of her desolated
parlor. When, however, she reached the
dining-room and beheld the exquisitely set
table, to the arrangement of which she had
devoted hours of thought in preceding days
and weeks, she burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you how it was,” said Budge, who
appeared suddenly and without invitation,
and whose consciousness of good intention
made him as adamant before the indignant
frowns of his uncle and aunt, “I always think
bonfires is the nicest things about celebrations,
an’ Tod an’ me have been carryin’
sticks for two days to make a big bonfire in
the back yard to-day. But it rained, an’
rainy sticks won’t burn. So we thought we’d
make one in the cellar, ’cause the top is all
tin, an’ the bottom’s all dirt, an’ it can’t rain
in there at all. An’ we got lots of newspapers
and kindlin’-wood, an’ put some kerosene
on it, an’ it blazed up beautiful, an’ we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
was just comin’ up to ask you all down to
look at it, when in came Uncle Harry, an’
banged me against the wall an’ Tod into the
coal heap, an’ threw a mean old dirty carpet
on top of it, an’ wetted it all over.”</p>

<p>“Little boysh never can do anyfing nysh
wivout bein’ made to don’t,” said Toddie.
“Dzust see what an awful big splinter I got
in my hand when I was froin’ wood on de
fire! I didn’t cry a bit about it den, ’cause I
fought I was makin’ uvver folks happy, like
de Lord wants little boysh to. But dey
didn’t get happy, so now I’m goin’ to cry
’bout de splinter!”</p>

<p>And Toddie raised a howl which was as
much superior to his usual cry as things made
to order generally are to the ordinary supply.</p>

<p>“We had a torchlight procession too,” said
Budge. “We had to have it in the attic, but
it wasn’t very nice. There wasn’t any trees
up there for the light to dance around on, like
it does on ’lection-day nights. So we just
stopped, an’ would have felt real doleful if
we hadn’t thought of the bonfire.”</p>

<p>“Where did you leave the torches?” asked
Mr. Burton, springing from his chair, and
lifting his wife to her feet at the same time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">“THREW A MEAN OLD DIRTY CARPET ON TOP OF IT”</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<p>“I&mdash;I dunno,” said Budge, after a moment
of thought.</p>

<p>“Froed ’em in a closet so’s not to dyty de
nice floor wif ’em,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>Mr. Burton hurried up-stairs and extinguished
a smoldering heap of rags, while his
wife, truer to herself than she imagined she
was, drew Budge to her, and said, kindly:</p>

<p>“Wanting to make people happy, and
doing it, are two very different things,
Budge.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I should think they was,” said
Budge, with an emphasis which explained
much that was left unsaid.</p>

<p>“Little boysh is goosies for tryin’ to make
big folksh happy at all,” said Toddie, beginning
again to cry.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, they’re not, dear,” said Mrs. Burton,
taking the sorrowful child on her lap.
“But they don’t always understand how best
to do it, so they ought to ask big folks before
they begin.”</p>

<p>“Den dere wouldn’t be no s’prises,” complained
Toddie. “Say, izh we goin’ to eat
all dis supper?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, if we can,” sighed Mrs.
Burton.</p>

<p>“I guesh we can&mdash;Budgie an’ me,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
Toddie. “An’ won’t we be glad all them
wimmens wented away!”</p>

<p>That evening, after the boys had retired,
Mrs. Burton seemed a little uneasy of mind,
and at length she said to her husband:</p>

<p>“I feel guilty at never having directed the
boys’s devotions since they have been here,
and I know no better time than the present
in which to begin.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton’s eyes followed his wife reverently
as she left the room. The service she
proposed to render the children she had
sometimes performed for himself, with results
for which he could not be grateful
enough, and yet it was not with unalloyed
anticipation that he softly followed her up
the stair. Mrs. Burton went into the chamber
and found the boys playing battering-ram,
each with a pillow in front of him.</p>

<p>“Children,” said she, “have you said your
prayers?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Budge; “somebody’s got to be
knocked down first. Then we will.”</p>

<p>A sudden tumble by Toddie was the signal
for devotional exercises, and both boys knelt
beside the bed.</p>

<p>“Now, darlings,” said Mrs. Burton, “you
have made some sad mistakes to-day, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
they should teach you that, even when you
want most to do right, you need to be helped
by somebody better. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Budge. “Lots.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” said Toddie. “More help I
getsh, de worse fings is. Guesh I’ll do fings
all alone affer dish.”</p>

<p>“I know what to say to the Lord to-night,
Aunt Alice,” said Budge.</p>

<p>“Dear little boy,” said Mrs. Burton. “Go
on.”</p>

<p>“Dear Lord,” said Budge, “we do have
the awfullest times when we try to make
other folks happy. Do, please, Lord, please
teach big folks how hard little folks have to
think before they do things for ’em. An’
make ’em understand little folks every way
better than they do, so that they don’t make
little folks unhappy when they try to make
big folks feel jolly. Make big folks have to
think as hard as little folks do. Amen! Oh
yes, an’ bless dear mamma an’ the sweet little
sister baby. How’s that, Aunt Alice?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton did not reply, and Budge, on
turning, saw only her departing figure, while
Toddie remarked:</p>

<p>“Now it’s my tyne. Dear Lord, when I
getsh to be a little boy anzel up in hebben,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
don’t let growed-up anzels come along whenever
I’m doin’ anyfing nysh for ’em, an’ say
’don’t’s or tumble me down in heaps of nashty
old black coal. Dere! Amen!”</p>

</div><div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>It was with a sneaking sense of relief that
Mrs. Burton awoke on the following morning,
and realized that the day was Sunday.</p>

<p>“Even school-teachers have two days of
rest in every seven,” she said to herself, “and
no one doubts that they deserve them. How
much more deserving of rest and relief must
be the volunteer teacher who, not for a few
hours only, but from dawn to twilight, has
charge of two children whose capacity for
both learning and mischief surely equals any
school full of boys.”</p>

<p>The feeling that she was attempting for a
few days only that which mothers everywhere
were doing without hope of rest excepting
in heaven, made her feel humble and
worthless, but it did not banish her wish to
turn the children over to the care of their
uncle for the day. Thoughts of a Sunday
excursion, from participation in which she
should in some way excuse herself; of volunteering
to relieve her sister-in-law’s nurse
during the day, and thus leaving her husband,
in charge of the house and the children; of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
making that visit to her mother which is
always in order with the young wife&mdash;all
these, and other devices not so practicable,
came before her mind’s eye for comparison,
but they all and together took sudden wing
when her husband awoke and complained of
a raging toothache. Truly pitiful and sympathetic
as Mrs. Burton was, she exhibited
remarkable resignation in the face of the
thought that her husband would probably
need to remain in his room all day, and that it
would be absolutely necessary to keep the
children out of his sight and hearing. Then
he could find nothing to criticise; she might
fail frequently, as she probably would, but he
would know only of her successes.</p>

<p>A light knock was heard at Mrs. Burton’
door, and then, without waiting for invitation
there came in two fresh, rosy faces, two heads
of disarranged hair, and two long white night-gowns,
and the occupant of the longer gown
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Say, Uncle Harry, do you know it’s Sunday?
What are you going to do about it?
We always have lots done for us Sundays,
’cause it’s the only day papa’s home.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I&mdash;think I’ve heard&mdash;something of
the kind&mdash;before,” mumbled Mr. Burton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
with difficulty, between the fingers that covered
his aching tooth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p137.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">TODDIE PLAYING BEAR</div>
</div>


<p>“Oh&mdash;h,” exclaimed Toddie, “I b’lieve
he’s goin’ to play bear! Come on, Budgie,
we’s got to be dogs.” And Toddie buried
his face in the bed-covering and succeeded in
fastening his teeth in his uncle’s calf. A
howl from the sufferer did not frighten off the
amateur dog, and he was finally dislodged only
by being clutched by the throat by his victim.</p>

<p>“Dat izhn’t de way to play bear,” complained
Toddie. “You ought to keep on
a-howlin’, an’ let me keep on a-bitin’, an’ den
you give me pennies to stop. Dat’s de way
papa does.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<p>“Can you see how Tom Lawrence can be
so idiotic?” asked Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“I suppose I could,” replied the sufferer,
“if I hadn’t such a toothache.”</p>

<p>“You poor old fellow!” said Mrs. Burton,
tenderly. Then she turned to her nephews,
and exclaimed: “Now, boys, listen to me!
Uncle Harry is very sick to-day&mdash;he has a
dreadful toothache, and every particle of
bother and noise will make it worse. You
must both keep away from his room, and be
as quiet as possible wherever you may be in
the house. Even the sound of people talking
is very annoying to a person with the
toothache.”</p>

<p>“Den you’s a baddy woman to stay in
here an’ keep a-talkin’ all de whole time,”
said Toddie, “when it makes poor old Uncle
Harry hurt so. G’way.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton’s lord and master was not in
too much pain to shake with silent laughter
at this rebuke, and the lady herself was too
startled to devise an appropriate retort, so
the boys amused themselves by a general
exploration of the chamber, not omitting the
pockets of their uncle’s clothing. This work
completed to the full extent of their ability,
they demanded breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

<p>“Breakfast won’t be ready until eight
o’clock,” said Mrs. Burton, “and it is now
only six. If you little boys don’t wish to
feel dreadfully hungry you had better go back
to bed and lie as quiet as possible.”</p>

<p>“Is dat de way not to be hungry?” asked
Toddie, with the wide-open eyes, which
always accompany the receptive mind.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Mrs. Burton. “If you
run about, you agitate your stomachs, and
that makes them restless, so you feel hungry.”</p>

<p>“Gwacious!” said Toddie. “What lots of
fings little boys has got to lyne, hazn’t dey?
Come on, Budgie; let’s go put our tummuks
to bed, an’keep ’em from gettin’ ajjerytated.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Budge. “But say, Aunt
Alice, don’t you s’pose our stomachs would
be sleepier an’ not so restless if there was
some crackers or bread an’ butter in ’em?”</p>

<p>“There’s no one down-stairs to get you
any,” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Budge, “we can find ’em. We
know where everything is in the pantries and
storeroom.”</p>

<p>“I wish I were so clever,” sighed Mrs.
Burton. “Go along; get what you like, but
don’t come back to this room again. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
don’t let me find anything in disorder down-stairs,
or I shall never trust you in my kitchen
again.”</p>

<p>Away flew the children, but their disappearance
only made room for a new torment,
for Mr. Burton stopped in the middle of the
operation of shaving himself, and remarked:</p>

<p>“I’ve been longing for Sunday to come, for
your sake, my dear. The boys, as you have
frequently observed, have very strange notions
about good things; but they are also,
by nature, quite spiritually minded. You
are not only this latter, but you are free from
strange doctrines and the traditions of men.
The mystical influences of the day will make
themselves felt upon those innocent little
hearts, and you will have an opportunity to
correct wrong teachings and instill new sentiments
and truths.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton’s voice had grown a bit shaky
as he reached the close of this neat little
speech, so that his wife scrutinized his face
closely to see if there might not be a laugh
somewhere about it. A friendly coating of
lather protected one cheek, however, and the
troublesome tooth had distorted the shape
of the other, so Mrs. Burton was compelled
to accept the mingled ascription of praise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
and responsibility, which she did with a
sinking heart.</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of them while you’re at
church, my dear,” said Mr. Burton. “They’re
always saintly with sick people.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton breathed a sigh of relief. She
determined that she would extemporize a
special “Children’s Service” immediately
after breakfast, and impress her nephews as
fully as possible with the spirit of the day;
then if her husband would but continue the
good work thus begun, it would be impossible
for the boys to fall from grace in the few
hours which remained between dinner time
and darkness. Full of her project, and forgetting
that she had allowed her chambermaid
to go to early service, and promised herself
to see that the children were dressed for
breakfast, Mrs. Burton, at the breakfast-table,
noticed that her nephews did not respond
with their usual alacrity to the call of
the bell. Recalling her forgotten duty, she
hurried to the boys’s chamber, and found
them already enjoying a repast which was
remarkable for variety. On a small table,
drawn to the side of the bed, was a pie, a
bowl of pickles, a dish of honey in the comb,
and a small package of cinnamon bark; with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
spoons, knives and forks and fingers the boys
were helping themselves to these delicacies.
Seeing his aunt, Toddie looked rather guilty,
but Budge displayed the smile of the fully
justified, and remarked:</p>

<p>“Now, you know what kind of meals little
boys like, Aunt Alice. I hope you won’t
forget it while we’re here.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean!” exclaimed Mrs.
Burton, sternly, “by bringing such things
up-stairs?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Budge, “you told us to get
what we wanted, an’ we supposed you told
the troof.”</p>

<p>“An’ I ain’t azh hungry azh I wazh,” said
Toddie, “but my tummuk feels as if it growed
big and got little again, every minute or two,
an’ it hurts. I wishes we could put tummuks
away when we get done usin’ ’em, like
we do hats an’ over-shoes.”</p>

<p>To sweep the remains of the unique morning
lunch into a heap and away from her
nephews, was a work which occupied but a
second or two of Mrs. Burton’s time; this
done, two little boys found themselves robed
more rapidly than they had ever before been.
Arrived at the breakfast-table, they eyed
with withering contempt an irreproachable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
cutlet, some crisp brown potatoes of waferlike
thinness, and a heap of rolls almost as
light as snowflakes.</p>

<p>“We don’t want none of this kind of breakfast,”
said Budge.</p>

<p>“Of coursh we don’t,” said Toddie, “when
we’s so awful full of uvver fings. I don’t
know where I’zhe goin’ to put my dinner
when it comes time to eat it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t fret about that, Tod,” said Budge.
“Don’t you know papa says that the Bible
says somethin’ that means ‘don’t worry till
you have to’?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton raised her eyebrows with horror
not unmixed with inquiry, and her husband
hastened to give Budge’s sentiment its
proper biblical wording, “Sufficient unto the
day is the evil thereof.” Mrs. Burton’
wonder was allayed by the explanation, although
her horror was not, and she made
haste to say:</p>

<p>“Boys, we will have a little Sunday-school,
all by ourselves, in the parlor immediately
after breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” shouted Budge. “An’ will
you give us a ticket an’ pass around a box for
pennies, just like they do in big Sunday-schools?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>“I&mdash;suppose so,” said Mrs. Burton, who
had not previously thought of these special
attractions of the successful Sunday-school.</p>

<p>“Let’s go right in, Tod,” said Budge,
“’cause the dog’s in there. I saw him as I
came down, and I shut all the doors so
he couldn’t get out. We can have some
fun with him ’fore Sunday-school begins.”</p>

<p>Both boys started for the parlor-door, and,
guided by that marvellous instinct with
which Providence arms the few against the
many, and the weak against the strong, the
dog Terry, also approached the door from
the inside. As the door opened there was
heard a convulsive howl, and a general tumbling
of small boys, while at almost the same
instant Terry flew into the dining-room and
hid himself in the folds of his mistress’s morning
robe. Two or three minutes later Budge
entered the dining-room with a very rueful
countenance, and remarked:</p>

<p>“I guess we need that Sunday-school
pretty quick, Aunt Alice. The dog don’t
want to play with us, and we ought to be
comforted some way.”</p>

<p>“They’re grown people, all over again,”
remarked Mr. Burton, with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

<p>“What do you mean?” demanded Mrs.
Burton.</p>

<p>“Only this; when their own devices fail,
they’re in a hurry for the consolations of
religion. May I visit the Sunday-school?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I can’t keep you away,” sighed
Mrs. Burton, leading the way to the parlor.
“Boys,” said she, greeting her nephews, “first
we’ll sing a little hymn. What shall it be?”</p>

<p>“Ole Uncle Ned,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s not a Sunday song.”</p>

<p>“I fink tizh,” said Toddie, “’cause it
sayzh, free or four timezh, ‘He’s gone where
de good niggers go,’s an’ dat’s hebben, you
know. So it’s a Sunday song.”</p>

<p>“I think ‘Glory, glory, hallelujah!’s is
nicer,” said Budge, “an’ I know it’s a Sunday
song, ’cause I’ve heard it in church.”</p>

<p>“Aw wight,” said Toddie; and he started
the old air himself, with the words, “There
liezh de whiskey-bottle, empty on de sheff,”
but was suddenly brought to order by a
shake from his aunt, while his uncle danced
about the front parlor in an ecstasy not
directly traceable to toothache.</p>

<p>“That’s not a Sunday song, either, Toddie,”
said Mrs. Burton. “The words are
real rowdyish. Where did you learn them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>“Round the corner from our housh,” said
Toddie; “an’ you can shing you ole shongs
yourseff, if you don’t like mine.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton went to the piano, rambled
among chords for a few seconds, and finally
recalled a Sunday-school air in which Toddie
joined as angelically as if his own musical
taste had never been impugned.</p>

<p>“Now, I guess we’d better take up the collection
before any little boys lose their pennies,”
said Budge, hurrying to the dining-room,
and returning with a strawberry-box
which seemed to have been specially provided
for the occasion; this he passed gravely before
Toddie, and Toddie held his hand over it
as carefully as if he were depositing hundreds,
and then Toddie took the box and passed it
before Budge, who made the same dumb
show, after which Budge retook the box,
shook it, listened, remarked, “It don’t rattle&mdash;I
guess it’s all paper-money to-day,” placed
it upon the mantel, reseated himself, and remarked:</p>

<p>“Now bring on your lesson.”</p>

<div class="caption">BUDGE TAKING UP THE COLLECTION</div>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Burton opened her Bible with a sense
of helplessness. With the instinct of a person
given to thoroughness, she opened at the
beginning of the book, but she speedily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
closed it again. Turning the leaves rapidly;
passing, for conscience’s sake, the record of
many a battle, the details of which would
have delighted the boys, and hurrying past
the prophecies as records not for the minds of
children, she at last reached the New Testament
and the ever-new story of the only boy
who ever was all that his parents and relatives
could wish him.</p>

<p>“The lesson will be about Jesus,” said Mrs.
Burton.</p>

<p>“Little-boy Jesus or big-man Jesus?” asked
Toddie.</p>

<p>“A&mdash;a&mdash;both,” replied the teacher, in confusion.</p>

<p>“Aw wight,” said Toddie. “G’won.”</p>

<p>“There was once a time when all the world
was in trouble, without knowing exactly
why,” said Mrs. Burton; “but the Lord understood
it, for He understands everything.”</p>

<p>“Does He know how it feels to be a little
boy,” asked Toddie, “an’ be sent to bed
when He don’t want to go?”</p>

<p>“And He determined to comfort the world,
as He always does when the world finds out it
can’t comfort itself,” continued Mrs. Burton,
ignoring her nephew’s questions.</p>

<p>“But wasn’t dere lotsh of little boyzh den?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>”
asked Toddie, “an’ didn’t they need to be
comforted as well as big folks?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. But He knew that if He
comforted grown people, they would make
the children happy.”</p>

<p>“I wiss He’d comfort you an’ Uncle Harry
ev’ry mornin’, den,” said Toddie. “G’won.”</p>

<p>“So He sent His own Son&mdash;His only Son&mdash;down
to the world to be a dear little baby.
And while smart people everywhere were
wondering what would or could happen to
quiet the restless heart of people&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Izh restless hearts like restless tummuks?”
interrupted Toddie. “Kind o’
pumpy an’ wabbley?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Poor folks!” said Toddie, clasping his
hands over his waistband. “I’zhe sorry for
’em.”</p>

<p>“While smart folks were trying to think out
what should be done,” continued Mrs. Burton,
“some shepherds, who used to sit around
at night under the moon and stars, and wonder
about things which they could not understand,
saw a wonderfully bright star in the
sky.”</p>

<p>“Was it one of the twinkle-twinkle kind, or
one of the stand-still kind?” asked Toddie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Mrs. Burton, after a
moment’s reflection. “Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“’Cauzh,” said Toddie, “I know what
’twazh dere for, an’ it ought to have twinkled,
’cauzh twinkley stars bob open an’ shut dat
way ’cauzh dey’re laughin’ an’ can’t keep
still, an’ I know I’d have laughed if I’d been
a star an’ was goin’ to make a lot of folks
awful happy. G’won.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Mrs. Burton, looking alternately
and frequently at the two accounts of
the Advent, “they suddenly saw an angel,
and the shepherds were afraid.”</p>

<p>“Should fink dey would be!” said Toddie.
“Everybody gets afraid when dey see good
people around. I ’pec dey thought de angel
would say ‘Don’t!’ in about a minute.”</p>

<p>“But the angel told them not to be afraid,”
said Mrs. Burton, “for he had come to bring
good news. There was to be a baby born at
Bethlehem, and He would make everybody
happy.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be nice if that angel would
come an’ do it all over again?” Budge asked.
“Only he ought to pick out little boys instead
of sheep fellows. I wouldn’t be afraid of an
angel.”</p>

<p>“Neiver would I,” said Toddie. “I’d dzust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
go round behind him an’ see how his wings
was fastened on.”</p>

<p>“Then a great many other angels came,”
said Mrs. Burton, “and they all sang together.
The shepherds didn’t know what to
make of it, but after the singing was over
they all started for Bethlehem to see that
wonderful baby.”</p>

<p>“Just like the other day we went to see the
sister-baby!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Burton; “but instead of
finding him in a pleasant home and a nice
room, with careful friends and nurses around
him, he was in a manger out in a stable.”</p>

<p>“That was ’cause he was so smart that he
could do just what he wanted to, an’ be just
where he liked,” said Budge, “an’ he was a
little boy, an’ little boys always like stables
better than houses. I wish I could live in a
stable always an’ for ever!”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Toddie, “an’ sleep in
mangers, ’cauzh den de horses would kick
anybody dat made me put on clean clozhezh
when I didn’t want to. Dey gaveded him
presentsh, didn’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Burton; “gold, frankincense,
and myrrh.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t they give him rattles and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
squealey-balls, like folks did budder Phillie
when he was a baby,” asked Toddie.</p>

<p>“Because, Toddie,” said Mrs. Burton, glad
of an opportunity to get the sentiment of the
story into her own hands, from which it had
departed very early in the course of the lesson&mdash;“because
he was no common baby, like
other children.”</p>

<p>“Did he play around, like uvver little
boysh?” continued Toddie.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;suppose so,” said Mrs. Burton,
fearing lest in trying to instill reverence into
her nephews, she herself might prove irreverent.</p>

<p>“Did somebody say ‘Don’t’ at him every
time he did anyfing?” continued Toddie.</p>

<p>“N&mdash;n&mdash;n&mdash;o! I imagine not,” said Mrs.
Burton, “because he was always good.”</p>

<p>“That don’t make no diffwelence,” said
Toddie. “De better a little boy triesh to be,
de more folks says ‘Don’t’ to him. So I
guesh nobody had any time to say anyfing
elsh at all to Jesus.”</p>

<p>“What did he do next?” asked Budge, as
deeply interested as if he had not heard the
same story many times before.</p>

<p>“He grew strong in body and spirit,” said
Mrs. Burton, “and everybody loved him; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
before he had time to do all that, an angel
came and frightened his papa in a dream, and
told him that the king of that country would
kill little Jesus if he could find him. So
Joseph and Mary, the mamma of the baby,
got up in the middle of the night and started
off to Egypt.”</p>

<p>“What did they do when they got there?”
Budge asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Mrs. Burton. “I
suppose the papa worked hard for money to
buy good food and comfortable resting-places
for his wife and the baby; and I suppose the
mamma walked about the fields, and picked
pretty flowers for her baby to play with; and
I suppose the baby cooed when his mamma
gave them to him, and laughed and danced
and played, and then got tired, and came and
hid his little face in his mamma’s lap, and
was taken into her arms and held ever so
tight, and fell asleep, and that his mother
looked into his face as if she would look
through it, while she tried to find out what
her baby would be and do when he grew up,
and whether he would be taken away from
her, while it seemed as if she couldn’t live at
all without having him very closely pressed
to her breast and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Burton’s voice grew a little shaky and
soon failed her entirely. Budge came in
front of her, scrutinized her intently but with
great sympathy also, rested his elbows on
her knees, dropped his face into his own
hands, looked up into her face, and said:</p>

<p>“Why, Aunt Alice, she was just like my
mamma, wasn’t she? An’ I think you are
just like both of ’em!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton took Budge into her arms,
covered his face with kisses, and totally destroyed
another chance of explaining the
difference between the earthly and the heavenly
to her pupils, while Toddie eyed the
couple with evident disfavor, and said:</p>

<p>“I fink ’twould be nicer if you’d see if dinner
was bein’ got ready, instead of stoppin’
tellin’ stories an’ huggin’ Budgie. My tummuk’
all gotted little again.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton came back to the world of to-day
from that of history, though not without
a sigh, while the dog Terry, who had divined
the peaceful nature of the occasion so far as
to feel justified in reclining beneath his mistress’
chair, now contracted himself into the
smallest possible space, slunk out of the doorway,
and took a lively quickstep in the direction
of the shrubbery. Toddie had seen him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
however, and told Budge, and both boys
were soon in pursuit, noticing which, Terry
speedily betook himself to that distant retirement
which the dog who has experience
in small boys knows well how to discover and
maintain.</p>

<p>As the morning wore on the boys grew
restless, fought, drummed on the piano,
snarled when that instrument was closed,
meddled with everything that was within
reach, and finally grew so troublesome that
their aunt soon felt that to lose was cheaper
than to save, so she left the house to the
children, and sought the side of the lounge
upon which her afflicted husband reclined.
The divining sense of childhood soon found
her out, however, and Budge remarked:</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice, if you’re going to church,
seems to me it’s time you was getting ready.”</p>

<p>“I can’t go to church, Budge,” sighed Mrs.
Burton. “If I do, you boys will only turn
the whole house upside down, and drive your
poor uncle nearly crazy.”</p>

<p>“No, we won’t,” said Budge. “You don’t
know what nice nurses we can be to sick
people. Papa says nobody can even imagine
how well we can take care of anybody until
they see us do it. If you don’t believe it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
just leave us with Uncle Harry, an’ stay
home from church an’ peek through the keyhole.”</p>

<p>“Go on, dear,” said Mr. Burton. “If you
want to go to church, don’t be afraid to leave
me. I think you should go, after your experience
of this morning. I shouldn’t think
your mind could be at peace until you had
joined your voice with that of the great congregation,
and acknowledged yourself to be
a miserable sinner.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p155.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">TERRY</div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Burton winced, but nevertheless retired,
and soon appeared dressed for church,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
kissed her husband and her nephews, gave
many last instructions, and departed. Budge
followed her with his eye until she had stepped
from the piazza, and then remarked, with a
sigh of relief:</p>

<p>“Now I guess we’ll have what papa calls a
good, old-fashioned time, for we’ve got rid of
her.”</p>

<p>“Budge!” exclaimed Mr. Burton, sternly,
and springing to his feet, “do you know who
you are talking about? Don’t you know that
your Aunt Alice has saved you from many a
scolding, done you many a favor, and been
your best friend?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Budge, with at least a
dozen inflections on each word, “but ev’ry
day friends an’ Sunday friends are kind o’
different; don’t you think so? She can’t
make whistles, or catch bullfrogs, or carry
both of us up the mountain on her shoulders,
or sing ‘Roll, Jordan.’”</p>

<p>“And do you expect me to do all these
things to-day?”</p>

<p>“N&mdash;n&mdash;no, unless you should get well,
an’ feel just like it; but we’d like to be with
somebody who could do ’em if he wanted to.
We like ladies that’s all ladies, but then we
like men that’s all men, too. Aunt Alice is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
good deal like an angel, I think, and you&mdash;well,
you ain’t. An’ we don’t want to be
with angels all the time until we’re angels
ourselves.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton turned over suddenly and contemplated
the back of the lounge, while
Budge continued:</p>

<p>“We don’t want you to get to be an angel,
so what I want to know is, how to make you
well. Don’t you think if I borrowed papa’
horse and carriage an’ took you ridin’ you’d
feel better? I know he’d lend ’em to me if I
told him you were goin’ to drive.”</p>

<p>“And if you said you would go with me to
take care of me?” suggested Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“Y&mdash;e&mdash;es,” said Budge, as hesitatingly
as if such an idea had never occurred to him.
“An’ don’t you think that up to the top of
Hawksnest Rock an’ out to Passaic Falls
would be the nicest places for a sick man to
go? When you got tired of ridin’ you could
stop the carriage an’ cut us a cane, or make
us whistles, or even send us in swimming in a
brook somewhere if you got tired of us.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” grunted Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“An’ you might take fings to eat wif you,”
suggested Toddie, “an’ when you got real
tired and felt bad you might stop an’ have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
little picnic. I fink dat would be dzust de
fing for a man wif de toofache. And we
could help you, lotsh.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see how I feel after dinner,” said Mr.
Burton. “But what are you going to do for
me between now and then, to make me feel
better?”</p>

<p>“We’ll tell you storiezh,” said Toddie.
“Dem’s what sick folks alwayzh likesh.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mr. Burton. “Begin
right away.”</p>

<p>“Aw wight,” said Toddie. “Do you
wantsh a sad story or a d’zolly one?”</p>

<p>“Anything. Men with the toothache can
stand nearly anything. Don’t draw on your
imagination too hard.”</p>

<p>“Don’t never draw on no madzinasuns,”
said Toddie; “I only draws on slatesh.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Give us the story.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Toddie, seating himself in a
little rocking-chair, and fixing his eyes on the
ceiling, “guesh I’ll tell about AbrahammynIsaac.
Onesh de Lord told a man named
Abraham to go up the mountain an’ chop
his little boy’s froat open an’ burn him up on
a naltar. So Abraham started to go do it.
An’ he made his little boy Isaac, dat he was
going to chop and burn up, carry de kindlin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>’
wood he was goin’ to set him a-fire wif. An’
I want to know if you fink dat wazh very
nysh of him?”</p>

<p>“Well, no.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what,” said Budge, “you don’t
ever catch me carryin’ sticks up the mountain,
even if my papa wants me to.”</p>

<p>“When they got up dere,” said Toddie,
“Abraham made a naltar an’ put little Ikey
on it, an’ took a knife an’ was goin’ to chop
his froat open, when a andzel came out of
hebben, an’ said: ‘Stop a-doin’ dat!’s So
Abraham stopped, an’ Ikey skooted. An’
Abraham saw a sheep caught in de bushes,
an’ he caught him an’ killed him. He wasn’
goin’ to climb way up a mountain to kill
somebody an’ not have his knife bluggy a bit.
An’ he burned de sheep up. An’ den he
went home again.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you Isaac’s mamma never knew
what his papa wanted to do with him,” said
Budge, “or she’d never let her little boy go
away in the mornin’. Do you want to bet?”</p>

<p>“N&mdash;no, not on Sunday,” said Mr. Burton.
“Now, suppose you little boys go out of doors
and play for a while, while uncle tries to get
a nap.”</p>

<p>The boys accepted the suggestion and dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>appeared.
Half an hour later, as Mrs. Burton
was walking home from church under
escort of old General Porcupine, and enduring
with saintly fortitude the general’s compliments
upon her management of the children,
there came screams of fear and anguish from
the general’s own grounds, which the couple
were passing.</p>

<p>“Who can that be?” exclaimed the general,
his short hairs bristling like the quills
of his titular godfather. “We have no
children.”</p>

<p>“I think I know the voices,” gasped Mrs.
Burton, turning pale.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul!” exclaimed the general,
with an accent which showed that he was
wishing the reverse of blessings upon souls
less needy than his own. “You don’t
mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do!” said Mrs. Burton, wringing
her hands. “Please hurry!”</p>

<p>The general puffed and snorted up his
gravel walk and toward the shrubbery, behind
which was a fishpond from which direction
the sound came. Mrs. Burton followed
in time to see her nephew Budge help his
brother out of the pond while the general
tugged at a large crawfish which had fastened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
its claw upon Toddies finger. The fish was
game, but, with a mighty pull from the general,
and a fiendish shriek from Toddie, the
fish’s claw and body parted company, and
the general, still holding the latter tightly,
staggered backward and himself fell into the
pond.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p160.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE GENERAL FELL INTO THE POND</div>
</div>


<p>“Ow&mdash;ow&mdash;ow!” howled Toddie, clasping
the skirt of his aunt’s mauve silk in a ruinous
embrace, while the general floundered and
snorted like a whale in dying agonies and
Budge laughed as merrily as if the whole
scene had been provided especially for his
entertainment. Mrs. Burton hurried her
nephews away, forgetting, in her mortification,
to thank the general for his service, and
placing a hand over Toddie’s mouth.</p>

<p>“It hurts!” mumbled Toddie.</p>

<p>“What did you touch the fish at all for?”
asked Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“It was a little baby-lobster,” sobbed Toddie,
“an’ I loves little babies&mdash;all kinds of
’em&mdash;an’ I wanted to pet him. An’ den I
wanted to grop him.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you do it?” demanded the
lady.</p>

<p>“’Cauzh he wouldn’t grop,” said Toddie.
“He isn’t all gropped yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<p>True enough, the claw of the fish still hung
at Toddies finger, and Mrs. Burton spoiled a
pair of four-button kids in detaching it,
while Budge continued to laugh. At length,
however, mirth gave place to brotherly love,
and Budge tenderly remarked:</p>

<p>“Toddie dear, don’t you love Bother
Budgie?”</p>

<p>“Yesh,” sobbed Toddie.</p>

<p>“Then you ought to be happy,” said
Budge, “for you’ve made him awful happy.
If the fish hadn’t caught you, the general
couldn’t have pulled him off, an’ then he
wouldn’t have tumbled into the pond, an’ oh,
my&mdash;didn’t he splash bully!”</p>

<p>“Then you’s got to be bited wif a fiss yourself,”
said Toddie, “an’ make him tumble in
again, for me to laugh ’bout.”</p>

<p>“You’re two naughty boys,” said Mrs.
Burton. “Is this the way you take care of
your sick uncle?”</p>

<p>“We did take care of him!” exclaimed
Toddie. “Told him a lovaly Bible story, an’
you didn’t, an’ he wouldn’t have had not no
Sunday at all if I hadn’t done it. An’ we’
goin’ to take him widin’ dis afternoon.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton hurried home, but it seemed
to her that she had never met so many in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>quiring
acquaintances during so short a walk.
Arrived at last, she ordered her nephews to
their room, and flung herself in tears beside
her husband, murmuring:</p>

<p>“Harry!”</p>

<p>And Mr. Burton, having viewed the ruined
dress with the eye of experience, uttered the
single word:</p>

<p>“Boys!”</p>

<p>“What am I to do with them?” asked the
unhappy woman.</p>

<p>Mr. Burton was an affectionate husband.
He adored womankind, and sincerely bemoaned
its special grievances; but he did not
resist the temptation to recall his wife’s announcement
of five days before, so he whispered:</p>

<p>“Train them.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton’s humiliation by her own lips
was postponed by a heavy footfall, which, by
turning her face, she discovered was that of
her brother-in-law, Tom Lawrence, who remarked:</p>

<p>“Tender confidences, eh? There’s nothing
like them, if you want to be happy. But
Helen’s pretty well to-day, and dying to have
her boys with her, and I’m even worse with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
similar longing. You can’t spare them, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>The peculiar way in which Tom Lawrence’
eyes danced as he awaited a reply would, at
any other time, have aroused all the defiance
in Alice Burton’s nature; but now, looking
at the front of her beautiful dress, she only
said:</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;I suppose&mdash;we might spare them
for an hour or two.”</p>

<p>“You poor, dear Spartan,” said Tom,
with genuine sympathy, “You shall be at
peace until their bedtime.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Burton found occasion to rearrange
the bandage on her husband’s face so
as to whisper in his ear:</p>

<p>“Thank heaven!”</p>

<p>The boys returned to the Burtons fast
asleep, Budge in his father’s arms, and
Toddie’s head pillowed on the shoulder of
faithful Mike. No sound was heard from
either of them until the next morning, when
finding that they slept later than usual, their
aunt went to their chamber to arouse them.
She found Budge sitting up in bed rubbing
his eyes with one hand, while with the other
he shook his brother, and elicited some ugly
grunts of remonstrance.</p>

<p>“Tod!” exclaimed Budge; “Tod! Wake
up! We ain’t where we was!”</p>

<p>“Don’t care if we ain’t,” drawled Toddie.
“I’zhe in&mdash;a&mdash;nicer playsh. I’zhe in&mdash;big
candy-shop.”</p>

<p>“No, you ain’t,” said Budge, trying to
pick his brother’s eyes open. “You’re at
Aunt Alice’, and when you went to sleep you
was at mamma’s house.”</p>

<p>“Pw&mdash;w&mdash;w&mdash;!” cried Toddie, arising
slowly; “you’s a hateful bad boy, Budgie. I
was a-dreamin’ I was in a candystore, an’
gotted all my pockets full an’ bof hands full,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
too, an’ now you’s woketed me up an’ my
hands is all empty, an’ I hazn’t got any
pocket-clozhezh on me at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, next time you have a dream I won’t
wake you at all, even if you have nightmares
an’ dream awful things. Say, Aunt Alice,
how do folks dream, I wonder? What makes
everythin’ go away an’ be somethin’ else?”</p>

<p>“It is the result of indistinct impressions
upon a semi-dormant brain,” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton thought she detected a note of
sarcasm in her nephew’s exclamation, but he
was so young and he seemed so meek of
countenance that she abandoned the idea.
Besides, her younger nephew had been saying
“Aunt Alish&mdash;Aunt Alish&mdash;Aunt Alish&mdash;Aunt
Alish&mdash;” as rapidly as he could with an
increasing volume of voice. Mrs. Burton
found time in which to say:</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Did you say pwessin’ on bwains made us
dweam fings, Aunt Alish?”</p>

<p>“Ye&mdash;es,” Mrs. Burton replied. “That is
the&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” interrupted Toddie. “Jzust
you sit down on my head an’ make dat candy-shop
come back again, won’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

<p>“Say, Aunt Alice,” said Budge, “do you
know that lots of times I don’t know any
more than I knew before.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you, Budge.”</p>

<p>“Why, when folks tell me things&mdash;I mean,
I ask them how things are, an’ they tell me,
an’ then I don’t
know any better
than I did before.
Is that the way
it is with grown
folks?”</p>

<div class="caption">“DREAMIN’ I WAS IN A CANDY-STORE”</div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Burton reflected
for a moment
and recalled many
experiences very
much like that
of Budge&mdash;experiences,
too, in
which she had
forced the same
impassive face that Budge wore, as she pretended
to comprehend that which had been
imperfectly explained. She remembered, too,
how depressing had been the lack of understanding,
and how strong was the sense of
injury at being required to act as if her
comprehension had been perfectly reached.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
Whether the topics had been the simple
affairs of childhood, or the social, æsthetic
and religious instructions of adult age,
Mrs. Burton, like every one else, had been
told more than she understood, and misunderstood
many things she had been told,
and blamed her friends and the world for
her blunders and for lack of appreciation of
the intentions to which proper and fostering
training had never been applied. Was it
possible that she was repeating with her
nephews the blunders which others had committed
while attempting to shape her own
mind?</p>

<p>The thought threw Mrs. Burton into the
profoundest depths of reverie, from which
she was aroused by Budge, who asked:</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice, do you see the Lord?”</p>

<p>“No, Budge!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton,
with a start. “Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Budge, “you was lookin’ so
hard through the window, an’ right toward
where you couldn’t see anythin’ but sky; an’
your eyes had such an ever-so-far look in
them that I thought you must be lookin’
straight at the Lord.”</p>

<p>“If you sees Him,” said Toddie, “I wiss
you’d ask him to send that dream back again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
to-night; to push on my bwains an’ make it
come back, and then let me stay asleep until
I eat up all de candy I gotted into my pockets
an’ hands.”</p>

<p>The appearance of the chambermaid, who
came to dress the boys for breakfast, put an
end to the conversation, but Mrs. Burton
determined that it should be renewed at the
earliest opportunity, or, rather, that her discoveries
of her own shortcomings as a teacher
of children should lead to an early and practical
reformation.</p>

<p>The fit of mental abstraction into which
this resolution threw her was the cause of a
silence which puzzled her husband considerably,
for he could plainly see by her face that
no affair merely matured was at the bottom
of her reticence, and that what in men would
be called temper was equally absent from her
heart. In fact, the result upon Mrs. Burton’
face and actions was so beneficial that
the lady’s husband determined to plead
toothache as an excuse to remain at home for
a day and look at her.</p>

<p>The mere suggestion, however, elicited
from Mrs. Burton the mention of so many
absolute necessities which could be procured
only in the city and by her husband, that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
departed by a train even earlier than the
one upon which he usually travelled, and
with sensations very like those of a man
who has been forcibly ejected from a residence.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Burton led her nephews into
the sitting-room, seated herself, placed an
arm tightly about each little boy, and said:
“Children, is there anything that you
would very much like to know?”</p>

<p>“Yesh,” answered Toddie, promptly. “I’d
like to know what we’s going to have for
dinner to-day?”</p>

<p>“And I,” said Budge, “would like to
know when we’re all goin’ for a ride again.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean silly things of that sort,”
said Mrs. Burton, “but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ain’t silly fings!” said Toddie. “Deysh
what makesh ush happy.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton made a mental note of the
justice of the rebuke, and of its connection
with the subject of which her heart was already
full; but she was still Alice Mayton
Burton, a lady whose perceptions could not
easily prevent her from following the paths
which she had already laid out for herself, so
she replied:</p>

<p>“I know they are; but I want to teach you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
whatever you want to learn about matters
of more importance.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you want to play
school?” asked Budge. “Papa don’t think
school is healthy for children in warm
weather, an’ neither do we.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want to play school, but I
want to explain to you some of the things
which you say you don’t understand, though
people tell you all about them. It makes
Aunt Alice very unhappy to think that her
dear little nephews are troubled about understanding
things when they want so much
to do so. Aunt Alice was once a little bit of
a girl, and had just the same sort of trouble,
and she remembers how uncomfortable it
made her.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Budge, changing his position
until he could look into his aunt’s eyes.
“Did you ever have to wonder how big
moons got to be little again, an’ then have
big folks tell you they chopped up the old
moons an’ made stars of them, when you
knew the story must be an awful whopper?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“An’ didn’t you ever wunner what dinner
was goin’ to be made of, an’ den have big
folks just say ‘never mind’?” asked Toddie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Burton, giving Toddie a
light squeeze. “I’ve been through that,
too.”</p>

<p>“Why!” said Budge, “you was awful little
once, wasn’t you? Well, did you ever have
to wonder where God stood when he made
the world out of nothing?”</p>

<p>“An’ did you ever have to fink how the
sweet outsides got made onto date-stones an’
peach-pits?” asked Toddie.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“Then tell us all about ’em.”</p>

<p>“You asked me about dreams this morning,
dear,” said Mrs. Burton, addressing
Budge, “and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know I did,” said Budge; “but I’d
rather know about dates an’ peaches now. I
can’t dream any more till I go to bed; but I
can buy dates inside of a quarter of an hour,
if you’ll give me pennies. Oh, say&mdash;I’ll tell
you what&mdash;you send me to buy some, and
then you can explain about ’em easier. It’
so much nicer to see how things are than to
have to think about ’em.”</p>

<p>“I can’t spare you now, dear, to go after
dates. I may not have time to talk to you
when you get back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’d manage not to bother you. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
think we could find out all about ’em ourselves,
if we had enough of ’em to do it with.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mrs. Burton, compromising
reluctantly. “I’ll tell you about
something else at
present; then I will
give you some
money to purchase
dates, and you may
study them for
yourselves.”</p>

<div class="caption">“WONDER HOW BIG MOONS GOT
TO BE LITTLE AGAIN”</div>
</div>

<p>“All right. Now
tell us what makes
your dog Terry
always run away
whenever we want
him?”</p>

<p>“Because you
tease him so much,
whenever you
catch him that
you have made
him hate you,”
said Mrs. Burton,
delighted at the double opportunity to
speak distinctly and impart a lesson in
humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p>“Now, you’s gettin’ ready to say ‘Don’t,’”
Toddie complained. “Can’t little boysh lyne
noffin’ dat hazn’t got any mean old ‘Don’t’
in it?”</p>

<p>“I hope so, poor little fellow,” said Mrs.
Burton, repenting at once of her success.</p>

<p>“What would you like to know?”</p>

<p>Toddie opened his mouth and eyes, hung
his head to one side, meditated for two or
three minutes, and said:</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I wantsh to know whatsh
de reason dat when a little boy hazh been
eatin’ lotsh of buttananoes he can’t eat any
more, when he’s been findin’ out all the
whole time how awful good dey is?”</p>

<p>“Because his little stomach is full, and
when one’s stomach is full it knows enough
to stop wanting anything.”</p>

<p>“Then tummuks is gooses. I wiss I was
my tummuk dzust once; I’d show it how
never to get tired of buttananoes.”</p>

<p>“What I want to know,” said Budge, “is
how we have dreams, ’cause I don’t know
any more about it than I did before, after
what you told me this morning.”</p>

<p>“It’s a hard thing to explain, dear,” said
Mrs. Burton, as she endeavored to frame a
simple explanation. “We think with our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
brain, and when we sleep our brain sleeps
too, though sometimes it isn’t as sleepy as
the rest of our body; and when it is a little
wakeful it thinks the least bit, but it can’t
think straight, so each thought gets mixed
up with part of some other thought.”</p>

<p>“That’s the reason I dreamed last night
that a cow was sittin’ in your rockin’-chair
readin’ an
atlas,” said
Budge. “But
what made
me think
about cows
an rockin-chairs
an’ atlases
at all?”</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/p175.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“A COW READIN’s AN ATLAS”</div>
</div>

<p>“That’s one of
the things which
we can’t explain
about dreams,”
said Mrs. Burton. “We seem to remember
something that we have seen at some other
time, and our memories jumble against each
other, when two or three come at a time.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Toddie, “some night when
I’ze asleep I’m goin’ to fink about buttananoes
an’ red-herrin’ an’ ice-cream an’our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>grass
an’ hard-boiled eggs an’ candy an’ fried
hominy, an’ won’t I hazh a lovaly little tea-party
in bed, if all my finks djumbles togevver?
An’ I won’t djeam about any uvver
little boy wif me at all.”</p>

<p>“When I dream about dear little dead
brother Phillie,” said Budge, “don’t I do
anythin’ but just remember him? Don’t he
come down from heaven and see me in my
bed?”</p>

<p>“I imagine not, dear,” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Then what makes him look so white and
sunny, an’ smile so sweet, an’ flap his dear
little white wings close to my face so I can
touch ’em?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is because&mdash;because you
have thought of him looking that way,” said
Mrs. Burton, drawing Budge closer to her side
to hide the wistfulness of his face from her
eyes. “You’ve seen pictures of angels all in
white, with graceful wings, and you’ve
thought of little brother Phil looking that
way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Budge, burying his
face in his aunt’s robe and bursting into tears.
“I wish I hadn’t tried to find out about
dreamin’! I don’t ever want to learn about
anything else. If dear little angel Phillie is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
only a piece of a think in my brain when I’m
asleep, then there isn’t nothin’ that’s anythin’.
I always thought it was funny that he
began to go away as soon as I began to wake
up.”</p>

<p>“Cows don’t go ’way when I wakes up
from dreamin’ about ’em,” said Toddie. “I
’members ’em all day, an’ sees ’em whenever
I don’t want to.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton could not repress a smile,
while Budge raised his head, and said:</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it’s no good to be unhappy.
We’d better have fun than think
about things that’s awful sad. Can’t you
think of some new kind of a play for us?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t, at this minute,” said
Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Suppose you play store,” said Budge,
“an’ keep lots of nice things, like cakes an’
candies, an’ let us buy ’em of you for pins. Oh,
yes! an’ you give us the pins to buy ’em with.</p>

<p>“An’ do it ’fore it getsh dinner-time,” said
Toddie, “so de fings you sell us can get out of
the way in time, so we can get empty to get
fullded up at dinner.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do that,” said Mrs. Burton, “because
it would give you an excuse to eat between
meals.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span></p>

<p>“Then tell us stories,” Budge suggested;
“no, make a menagerie for us. Oh, no!&mdash;I’ll
tell you what, make believe it was our house,
an’ you was comin’ to visit us, an’ we’ll bring
you up cake an’ coffee to rest yourself with.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I smell some little mice!” said
Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“In the mouse-twap?” inquired Toddie.
“Oh! get ’em for ush to play wif!”</p>

<p>“Tell you what,” said Budge. “You can
tell us that funny story about the man that
had dogs for doctors.”</p>

<p>“Dogs for doctors?” echoed Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Budge; “don’t you know?
He’s in the Bible book.”</p>

<p>“He may be,” said Mrs. Burton, rapidly
passing in review such biblical dogs as she
could remember, “but I don’t know where.”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know?” continued Budge.
“He was that man that was so poor that he
had to eat crumbs, an’ papa don’t think he
had any syrup with ’em, either, like we do
when the cook gives us the crumbs out of the
bread-box.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible you mean Lazarus?” exclaimed
Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Yesh,” said Toddie, “dat was him.
’Twasn’t de Lazharus that began to live again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
after he was buried, though. He didn’t have
no dogs.”</p>

<p>“The poor man you mean,” said Mrs.
Burton, “was very sick and very poor, so
that he had to be fed with the scraps
that a rich man named Dives left at his
own table. But the Lord saw him and knew
what troubles he was having, and determined
that the poor man should be happy
after he died, to make up for the trouble
he had when he was alive. So when poor
Lazarus died the Lord took him right into
heaven.”</p>

<p>“Nobody has to eat table-scraps there, do
they?” said Budge. “But say, Aunt Alice,
what do they do in heaven with things that’
left at the table? Isn’t it wicked to throw
them away up there?”</p>

<p>“Should fink they’d cut a hole in the floor
of hebben an’ grop de scraps down froo, for
poor people,” said Toddie. “When I gets to
be an andzel, an’ gets done my dinners, I’m
goin’ to get up on the wall an’ froe the rest
over down into the world. Only I must be
careful not to grop off myself an’ tumble into
the wylde again.”</p>

<p>“What I want to know is,” said Budge,
“how do they get things to eat for the angels?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
Do they have grocery stores, an’ butcher
shops, an’ milk wagons up there?”</p>

<p>“Gracious, no!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton,
her fingers instinctively moving toward her
ears. “The Lord provides food in some way
that we don’t understand. But this poor
Lazarus, after he became an angel, looked
out of heaven, and saw, away off in the bad
place, the rich man whose leavings he used to
eat, for the rich man had died too. And the
rich man begged Abraham&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I fought his name was Lazharus?” said
Toddie.</p>

<p>“The poor man was named Lazarus,” said
Mrs. Burton; “but when he reached heaven
he found good old Abraham there, and Abraham
took care of him. And the rich man
begged Abraham to send Lazarus just to dip
his finger in water and rub it on the rich man’
lips, for he was so thirsty.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he get a drink for himself?”
asked Budge. “Can’t rich people wait on
themselves even when they die?”</p>

<p>“There is no water in the bad place,” said
Mrs. Burton. “That was why he was so
thirsty.”</p>

<p>“Goodnesh!” said Toddie. “How does
little boysh make mud-pies there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<p>“I hope no little boys ever go there,” said
Mrs. Burton. “But Abraham said: ‘Not so, my
friend. You had your good things while you
were alive;
now you
must get
along without
anything.
But
poor Lazarus must
be made happy, for
he had very bad
times when he was
alive!’”</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p181.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“HOW DO THEY GET THINGS TO
 EAT FOR THE ANGELS?”</div>
</div>

<p>“Is that the way
it is?” Budge asked.
“Then I guess Abraham
will have to do
lots for me when I
die, for I have a
good many bad
times nowadays.
Then what did the bothered old rich man
do about it?”</p>

<p>“He told Abraham that he had some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
brothers that were alive yet, and he wished
that an angel might be sent to tell them to be
good, so as never to have to come to that
dreadful place. But Abraham told him it
wouldn’t be of any use to send an angel. They
had good books and preachers that would tell
them what to do.”</p>

<p>“An’ did he have to go on bein’ thirsty forever?”
asked Budge.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Burton, with a
shudder, and realizing why it was that the
doctrine of eternal torment was not more industriously
preached from the pulpit.</p>

<p>“G’won!” remarked Toddie.</p>

<p>“That is all there is of it,” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Why you didn’t tell us a fing about the
doctor-dogs,” complained Toddie.</p>

<p>“Oh, those are not nice to tell about,” said
Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“I fink deysh dzust de nicest fing about de
story. Whenever I getsh a sore finger, I
goes an’ sits down by the back door an’ calls
Terry. But I don’t fink Terry’s a very good
doctor, ’cauzh he don’t come when I wants
him. One of dese days when I getsh lotsh of
soresh, like Jimmy McNally when he had the
smallpox, an’ Terry will want to see me awful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
I won’t let him see me a bit. Tell us ’nother
story.”</p>

<p>The sound of harp and fiddle came to Mrs.
Burton’s rescue, and the boys hurried to the
front of the house to behold two very small
Italians, who were doing their utmost to teach
adults the value of peace and quietness.</p>

<p>Budge and Toddie listened to the whole
repertoire of the couple, encored every selection,
bestowed in payment the pennies their
aunt gave them for the purpose, and proposed
to follow the musicians on their route
through the town, but their aunt stopped
them.</p>

<p>“What do those little fellows do with all
the pennies they get?” asked Budge. “Do
they buy candy with them?”</p>

<p>“What lotsh of candy they must have!”
exclaimed Toddie.</p>

<p>“I suppose they take their money home to
their papas and mammas,” said Mrs. Burton,
“for they are very poor people. Perhaps the
parents of those two little boys are sick at
this very moment, and are looking anxiously
for the return of their little boys who are so
far away.” (Mem. The first report of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children had not been published at that time.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

<p>“An’ do the little boys make all that music
dzust ’cauzh dey love somebody?” asked
Toddie.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p>“But folks always gets paid by the Lord
for doin’ things for other folks, don’t they,
Aunt Alice?” asked Budge.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear old fellow,” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“One fing nysh about dem little boysh,”
said Toddie, “ish dat, when their papas an’
mammas is sick, dere isn’t anybody to tell
’em not to get deir shoes dusty. Dzust see
how dey walksh along in the middle of the
street, kickin’ up de dust, an’ nobody to say
‘Don’t!’s to ’em, an’ nobody skrong enough to
spynk ’em for it when dey gets home. I wiss
I was a musicker.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’re gone now,” sighed Budge,
“’an we want something else to make us
happy. Say, Aunt Alice, why don’t you
have a horse an’ carriage like mamma, so that
you could take us out ridin’?”</p>

<p>“Uncle Harry isn’t rich enough to keep
good horses and carriages,” said Mrs. Burton,
“and he doesn’t like poor ones.”</p>

<p>“Why, how much does good horses cost?
I think Mr. Blanner’s horses are pretty good,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
but papa says they’d be dear at ten cents
apiece.”</p>

<p>“I suppose a good horse costs three or
four hundred dollars,” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“My&mdash;y&mdash;y!” exclaimed Budge. “That’
more money than it costs our Sunday-school
to pay for a missionary! Which is goodest&mdash;horses
or missionaries?”</p>

<p>“Missionaries, of course,” said Mrs. Burton,
leaving the piazza, with a dim impression
that she had, during the morning, answered
a great many questions with very slight benefit
to any one.</p>

<p>The boys cared for themselves until luncheon,
and then returned with rather less appetite
than was peculiar to them. The new
siege of questioning which their aunt had
anticipated was postponed; each boy’s mind
seemed to be in the reflective, rather than the
receptive, attitude.</p>

<p>After luncheon they hastily disappeared,
without any attempt on the part of their
aunt to prevent them, for Mrs. Burton had
arranged to make, that afternoon, one of the
most important of calls. Mrs. Congressman
Weathervane had been visiting a friend at
Hillcrest, and Mrs. Weathervane’s mother
and Mrs. Burton’s grandmother had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
schoolday acquaintances, and Mrs. Mayton
would have come from the city to pay her
respects to the descendant of the old friend
of the family, but some of the infirmities of
age prevented. And Mrs. Mayton instructed
her daughter to call upon Mrs. Weathervane
as a representative of the family,
and Mrs. Burton would have lost her right
hand or her new spring hat rather than
disregard such a command. So she had
hired a carriage and devised an irreproachable
toilet, and recalled and tabulated everything
she had ever heard about the family of
the lady who had become Mrs. Weathervane.</p>

<p>The carriage arrived, and no brace of boys
dashed from unexpected lurking-places to
claim a portion of its seats. The carriage
rolled off in safety, and Mrs. Burton fell into
an impromptu service of praise to the kind
power which often blesses us when we least
expect to be blessed. The carriage reached
the house and the terrible Mrs. Weathervane
turned out to be one of the most charming
of young women, before whose sunny temperament
Mrs. Burton’s assumed dignity
melted like the snow of May, and her store
of venerable family anecdotes disappeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
at once from the memory which had guarded
them jealously.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">THE SQUEAK OF THE VIOLIN AND THE WAIL OF A BADLY
PLAYED WIND INSTRUMENT</div>
</div>

<p>But joy is never unalloyed in this wicked
world. While the couple were chatting
merrily, and Mrs. Weathervane was insisting
that Mrs. Burton should visit her at Washington
during the session, and Mrs. Burton
was trying to persuade Mrs. Weathervane
to accept the Burton hospitality for at least
a day or two, there arose under the window
the squeak of violin and the wail of some
badly played wind instrument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<p>“Those wretched little Italians!” exclaimed
Mrs. Weathervane. “For which
of our sins, I wonder, are we condemned to
listen to them?”</p>

<p>“If they come as punishment for sins,”
said Mrs. Burton, “how wicked I must be,
for this is my second experience with them
to-day. They were at my house for half an
hour this morning.”</p>

<p>“And you are sweet of disposition this
afternoon?” said Mrs. Weathervane. “Oh!
I must spend a day or two with you, and
take some lessons in saintly patience.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton inclined her head in acknowledgment,
and Mrs. Weathervane approached
some other topic, when the violin under the
window gave vent to a series of terrible
groans of anguish, while the wind-instrument,
apparently a flute, shrieked discordantly in
three notes an octave apart from each other.</p>

<p>“An attempt to execute something upon
one string, I suppose,” said Mrs. Weathervane,
“and the execution is successful only
as criminal executions are. What should be
done to the little wretches? And yet one
can’t help giving them money; did you see
the story of their terrible life in the newspapers
this week? It seems they are hired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
in Italy by dreadful men, who bring them
here, torture them into learning their wretched
tunes and then send them out to play and
beg. They are terribly whipped if they do
not bring home a certain sum of money every
day.”</p>

<p>“The poor little things!” exclaimed Mrs.
Burton. “I’m glad that I gave them a good
many pennies this morning. I must have
had an intuition of their fate, for I’m certain
I had no musical enjoyment to be paid for.
They can hardly be as old as some children
in nurseries, either.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said Mrs. Weathervane,
going to the window. “The elder of these
two boys cannot be more than six, while the
younger may be four; and the older looks so
sad, so introspective! The younger&mdash;poor
little fellow&mdash;has only expectancy in his
countenance. He is looking up to all the
windows for the pennies that he expects to be
thrown to him. He has probably not had so
hard an experience as his companion, for his
instrument is only a common whistle. Think
of the frauds which their masters practise
upon the tender-hearted! The idea of sending
out a child with a common whistle on the
pretense of making music.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>“It’s perfectly dreadful!” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Then to think what the parents of some
of these children may have been,” continued
Mrs. Weathervane. “The older of this couple
has really many noble lines in his face,
did not the long-drawn agony of separation
and abuse inscribe deeper ones there. The
smaller one, vilely dirty as he is, has a very
picturesque head and figure. He is smiling
now. Oh! what wouldn’t I give if some
artist could catch his expression for me!”</p>

<p>“Really,” exclaimed Mrs. Burton, approaching
the window; “I hadn’t noticed so
many charms about them, but I shall be glad
to have them pointed out to me. Mercy!”</p>

<p>“What can be the matter?” murmured
Mrs. Weathervane, as her visitor fell back
from the window and dropped into a chair.</p>

<p>“They’re my nephews!” gasped Mrs. Burton.
“Oh, what shall I do with those dreadful
children?”</p>

<p>“Stolen from home?” inquired Mrs. Weathervane,
discerning a romance within reaching
distance.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;oh, no!” said Mrs. Burton. “I left
them at home an hour or two ago. I can’t
imagine why they should have taken this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
freak, unless because boys will be dreadful,
no matter what is done for them. I suppose,”
she continued, hurrying to the window,
“that Budge has his uncle’s violin,
which I think is fully as dear to its owner as
his wife. Yes, he has it! Boys!” exclaimed
Mrs. Burton, appearing at the piazza-door,
“go directly home.”</p>

<p>At the sound of their aunt’s voice the boys
looked up with glad smiles of recognition,
while Budge exclaimed, “Oh, Aunt Alice!
we’ve played at lots of houses, an’ we’ve got
nearly a dollar. We told everybody we was
playin’ to help Uncle Harry buy a horse an’
carriage!”</p>

<p>“Go home!” repeated Mrs. Burton. “Go
by the back road, too. I am going myself
right away. Be sure that I find you there
when I return.”</p>

<p>Slowly and sadly the amateurs submitted
to the fateful decree and moved toward
home, while Mrs Weathervane bestowed a
sympathetic kiss upon her troubled visitor.
A great many people came to doors and windows
to see the couple pass by, but what
was public interest to a couple whose motive
had been rudely destroyed? So dejected
was their mien as they approached the Bur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>ton
mansion, and so listless was their step,
that the dog Terry, who was on guard at the
front door, gave only an inquiring wag of his
tail, and did not change his position as the
boys passed over the door-mat upon which he
lay. A moment or two later a carriage dashed
up to the door, and Mrs. Burton descended,
hurried into the house, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“How dared you to do such a vulgar,
disgraceful thing?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Budge, “that’s another of the
things we don’t understand much about,
even after we’re told. We thought we could
be just as good to you an’ Uncle Harry as
dirty little Italian boys is to their papas an’
mammas, an’ when we tried it, you made us
go straight home.”</p>

<p>“Dzust the same fing as saying ‘Don’t’s at
us,” Toddie complained.</p>

<p>“An’ after we got a whole lot of money,
too!” said Budge. “Papa says some big
men don’t get more than a dollar in a day,
an’ we got most a dollar in a little bit of a
while. It’s partly because we was honest,
though, I guess, an’ told the troof everywhere&mdash;we
told everybody that we wanted
the money to help Uncle Harry to buy a
horse an’ carriage.”</p>

<div class="caption">UNCLE HARRY’S FRANTIC EXAMINATION OF HIS BELOVED
VIOLIN</div>
</div>


<p>Uncle Harry himself, moved by his aching
tooth, had returned from New York in time
to hear, unperceived, the last portion of
Budge’s explanation, after which he heard
the remainder of the story from his wife.
His expression
as he listened,
his glance at his
nephews, and
his frantic examination
of his beloved violin, gave the
boys to understand how utter is sometimes
the failure of good intentions to make happy
those persons for whose benefit they are exerted.
The somber reflections of the musi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>cians
were unchanged by anything which occurred
during the remainder of the afternoon,
and when they retired, it was with a full but
sorrowful heart that Budge prayed: “Dear
Lord, I’ve been scolded again for tryin’ to do
somethin’ real nice for other people. I
guess it makes me know something about
how the good prophets felt. Please don’t
let me have to be killed for doin’ good.
Amen.”</p>

<p>And Toddie prayed: “Dee Lord, dere’
some more ‘Don’t’s been said to me, an’ I
fink Aunt Alice ought to be ’hamed of herself.
Won’t you please make her so? Amen.”</p>

</div><div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>“That,” murmured Mrs. Burton on Tuesday
morning, as she prepared to descend
to the breakfast table, “promises a pleasant
day.” Then, in a louder tone, she said to
her husband: “Harry, just listen to those
dear children singing! Aren’t their voices
sweet?”</p>

<p>“’Sing before breakfast, cry before dark,’”
quoted Mr. Burton, quoting a popular saying.</p>

<p>“For shame!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton.
“And when they’re singing sweet little child-hymns
too! There! they’re starting another.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton took the graceful listening
attitude peculiar to ladies, her husband stood
in the military position of “attention,” and
both heard the following morceau:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“I want&mdash;to be&mdash;an an&mdash;gel</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">An’ with&mdash;the an&mdash;gels stand;</div>
  <div class="verse">A crown&mdash;upon&mdash;my fore&mdash;head</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">A hop&mdash;per in&mdash;my hand.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Hopper&mdash;h’m!” said Mr. Burton. “They
refer to the hind-leg of a grasshopper, my
dear. The angelic life would be indeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
dreary to those youngsters without some such
original plaything.”</p>

<p>“You ought to be ashamed of yourself!”
said the lady. “I hope you won’t suggest
any such notion to them. I don’t believe
they would have had so many peculiar views
about the next world if some one hadn’t exerted
an improper influence&mdash;you and your
brother-in-law Tom Lawrence, their father,
for instance.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Burton, “if they are so
susceptible to the influence of others, I suppose
you have them about reformed in most
respects? You have had entire charge of
them for seven days.”</p>

<p>“Six&mdash;only six,” corrected Mrs. Burton,
hastily. “I wish&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That there really was one day less for
them to remain?” said Mr. Burton, looking
his wife full in the face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton dropped her eyes quickly, trying
first to turn in search of something she
did not want, but her husband knew his
wife’s nature too much to be misled by this
ruse. Putting as much tenderness in his
voice as he knew how to do, he said:</p>

<p>“Little girl, tell the truth. Haven’t you
learned more than they?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Burton still kept her eyes out of range
of those of her husband, but replied with
composure:</p>

<p>“I have learned a great deal, as one must
when brought in contact with a new subject,
but the acquired knowledge of an adult is the
source of new power, and of much and more
knowledge to be imparted.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton contemplated his wife with
curiosity which soon made place for undisguised
admiration, but when he turned his
face again to the mirror he could see in its
expression nothing but pity. Meanwhile the
cessation of the children’s songs, the confused
patter of little feet on the stair, and an agonized
yelp from the dog Terry, indicated that
the boys had left their chamber. Then the
Burtons heard their own door-knob turned,
an indignant kick which followed the discovery
that the door was bolted, and then a
shout of:</p>

<p>“Say!”</p>

<p>“What’s wanted?” asked Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“I want to come in,” answered Budge.</p>

<p>“Me, too,” piped Toddie.</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>A moment of silence ensued, and then
Budge answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

<p>“Why, because we do. I should think
anybody would understand that without
asking.”</p>

<p>“Well, we bolted the door because we
didn’t want any one to come in. I should
think anybody could understand that without
asking.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, I’ll tell you what we want to
come in for; we want to tell you something
perfectly lovely.”</p>

<p>“Do you wish to listen to an original romance,
my dear?” asked Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the lady.</p>

<p>“And break your resolution to teach them
that our chamber is not a general ante-breakfast
gathering-place?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they won’t infer anything of the kind
if we admit them just once,” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“H’m&mdash;we won’t count this time,” quoted
Mr. Burton from “Rip Van Winkle,” with a
suggestive smile, which was instantly banished
by a frown from his wife. Mr. Burton
dutifully drew the bolt and both boys tumbled
into the room.</p>

<p>“We were both leaning against the door,”
explained Budge; “that’s why we dropped
over each other. We knew you’d let us in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

<p>Mr. Burton gave his wife another peculiar
look which the lady affected not to notice as
she asked:</p>

<p>“What is the lovely thing you were going
to tell us?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;” interrupted Toddie.</p>

<div class="caption">BOTH BOYS TUMBLED INTO THE ROOM</div>

<p>“Tod, be still!” commanded Budge. “I
began it first.”</p>

<p>“But I finked it fyst,” expostulated Toddie.</p>

<p>[Ilustration: BOTH BOYS TUMBLED INTO THE ROOM]</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, then, Tod&mdash;I’ll tell ’em
about it an’ you worry ’em to do it. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>’
fair, isn’t it?” and then, without awaiting the
result of Toddie’s deliberations Budge continued:</p>

<p>“What we want is a picnic. Papa’ll lend
you the carriage, and we’ll get in it and go up
to the Falls, and have a lovely day of it.
That’s just the nicest place I ever saw. You
can swing us in the big swing there, an’ take
us in swimmin’, an’ row us in a boat, an’ buy
us lemonade at the hotel, an’ we can throw
stones in the water, an’ paddle, an’ catch fish,
an’ run races. All these other things&mdash;not
the first ones I told you about&mdash;we can do for
ourselves, an’ you an’ Aunt Alice can lie on
the grass under the trees, an’ smoke cigars,
an’ be happy, ’cause you’ve made us happy.
That’s the way papa does. An’ you must
take lots of lunch along, ’cause little boys gets
pretty empty-feeling when they go to such
places. Oh, yes&mdash;an’ you can throw Terry in
the water an’ make him swim after sticks&mdash;I’ll
bet he can’t get away there without our
catching him.”</p>

<p>“But de lunch has got to be lots,” said
Toddie, “else dere won’t be any fun&mdash;not one
bittie. An’ you’ll take us, won’t you? We’ze
been dreadful good all mornin’. I’ze singed
Sunday songs until my froat’s all sandy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></p>

<p>“All what?” asked Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Sandy,” replied Toddie. “Don’t you
know how funny it feels to rub sand between
your hands when you hazhn’t got djuvs on?
If you don’t, I’ll go bring you in some.”</p>

<p>“Your aunt will take your word for it,”
said Mr. Burton, as his wife did not respond.</p>

<p>“An’ we’ll be awful tired after the picnic’
done,” said Budge, “an’ you can hold us in
your arms in the carriage all the way back.
That’s the way papa an’ mamma does.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mr. Burton. “That
will be an inducement. And it explains why
your papa can make a new coat look old
quicker than any other man of my acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“And why your mother always has a skirt
to clean or mend,” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“It’s all told now, Tod,” said Budge.
“Why don’t you worry ’em?”</p>

<p>Toddie clasped his aunt’s skirts affectionately,
and said, in most appealing tones:</p>

<p>“You’e a-goin’ to, izhn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Papa says it was always easier for you to
say ‘yes’s than ‘no,’” remarked Budge; “an’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A fine reputation your brother-in-law
gives you,” remarked Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

<p>“An’ I once heard a lady say she thought
you said ‘yes’s pretty easy,” continued Budge,
addressing his aunt. “I thought she meant
something that you said to Uncle Harry, by
the way she talked.” Mrs. Burton flushed
angrily, but Budge continued: “An’ you
ought to be as good to us as you are to him,
’cause he’s a big man, an’ don’t have to be
helped every time he wants any fun. Besides,
you’ve got him all the time, but you
can only have us four days longer&mdash;three
days besides to-day.”</p>

<p>“Another paraphrase of Scripture&mdash;application
perfect,” remarked Mr. Burton to his
wife. “Shall we go?”</p>

<p>“Can you?” asked the lady, suddenly
grown radiant.</p>

<p>“I suppose&mdash;oh, I know I can,” replied
Mr. Burton, assuming that the anticipation
of a day in his society was the sole cause of
his wife’s joy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton knew his thoughts but failed
to correct them, guilty though she felt at her
neglect. That she would be practically relieved
of responsibility during the day was
the cause of her happiness. The children had
always preferred the companionship of their
uncle to that of his wife; she had at times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
been secretly mortified and offended at this
preference, but in the week just ending she
had entirely lost this feeling.</p>

<p>The announcement that their host and
hostess thought favorably of the proposition
was received by the boys with lively manifestations
of delight, and for two hours no other
two persons in the state were more busy than
Budge and Toddie. Even their appetites
gave way under the excitement and their
stay at the breakfast table was of short
duration.</p>

<p>Budge visited his father and arranged for
the use of the carriage while Toddie superintended
the packing of the eatables until the
cook banished him from the kitchen, and protected
herself from subsequent invasion by
locking the door. Then both boys suggested
enough extra luggage to fill a wagon and volunteered
instructions at a rate which was not
retarded by the neglect with which their
commands were received.</p>

<p>When the last package was taken into the
carriage the dog Terry was helped to a seat
and the party started. They had been <i>en
route</i> about five minutes, when Budge remarked:</p>

<p>“Uncle Harry, I want a drink.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>

<p>“Uncle Harry,” said Toddie, “I’m ’most
starved to deff. I didn’t have hardly any
brekspup.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Mrs. Burton. “Wasn’t
there plenty on the table?”</p>

<p>“I doe know,” Toddie replied, looking
inquiringly into his aunt’s face as if to refresh
his memory.</p>

<p>“Weren’t you hungry at breakfast-time?”
continued Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;why, yesh&mdash;I mean my tummuk
wazh hungry, but my toofs wasn’t&mdash;dat’
de way it wazh. An’ I guesh what I’d
better have now is sardines an’ pie.”</p>

<p>“Ethereal creature!” exclaimed Mr. Burton,
giving Toddie a cracker.</p>

<p>“I didn’t remember that I was hungry,”
said Budge, “but Tod’s talking about it reminds
me. An’ I’d like that drink, too.”</p>

<p>Budge also received some crackers and the
carriage was stopped near a well. The descent
of Mr. Burton from the carriage compelled
the dog Terry to change his base,
which operation was so impeded by skillful
efforts on the part of the boys that Terry
suddenly leaped to the ground and started
for home, followed by a remonstrance from
Toddie, while Budge remarked:</p>

<div class="caption">TODDIE DRANK ABOUT TWO SWALLOWS OF WATER</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span></p>

<p>“He won’t ever go to heaven, Terry won’t.
He don’t like to make people happy.”</p>

<p>Away went the carriage again and it had
reached the extreme outskirts of the town
when Toddie said:</p>

<p>“I’m awful fursty.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you drink when Budge did?”
demanded Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“’Cauzh I didn’t want to,” replied Toddie.
“I izhn’t like old choo-choos dat getsh filled
up dzust ’cause dey comes to a watering
playzh. I only likesh to dwink when I’zhe
fursty; an’ I’zhe fursty now.”</p>

<p>Another well was approached; Toddie
drank about two swallows of water, and replied
to his aunt’s declaration that he couldn’t
have been thirsty at all by the explanation:</p>

<p>“I doezn’t hold very much. I izhn’t like
de horsesh, dat can dwink whole pails full of
water, an’ den hazh room for gwash. But
I guesh I’zhe got room for some cake.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll give you another cracker,” said
Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“Don’t want one,” said Toddie. “Cwacker
couldn’t push itself down as easy as cake.”</p>

<p>“I do believe,” said Mrs. Burton, “that the
child’s animal nature has taken complete
possession of him. Eating and mischief has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
been the whole of his life during the week, yet
he used to be so sweetly fanciful and sensitive.”</p>

<p>“Children’s wits are like the wind, my
dear,” said Mr. Burton. “’Thou canst not
tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth’;
you set your sails for it, and behold it isn’t
there, but when you’re not expecting it,
down comes the gale.”</p>

<p>“A gale!” echoed Budge. “That’s what
we’re goin’ to have to-day.”</p>

<p>“Izn’t neiver,” said Toddie. “Goin’ to
hazh a picnic.”</p>

<p>“Well, gales and picnics is the same thing,”
said Budge.</p>

<p>“No, dey izhn’t. Galesh is kind o’s rough,
but picnics is nysh. Galesh is like rough
little boysh, like you, but picnics is nysh,
like dear little sister-babies.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” sighed Budge, “we haven’t
seen that baby for two days. Let’s go right
back an’ look at her.”</p>

<p>“Budge, Budge!” remonstrated Mrs. Burton;
“try to be content with what you have,
and don’t always be longing for something
else. You can go to see her when we return.”</p>

<p>“I can see her wivout goin’ back,” said
Toddie. “I can see anybody I wantsh to,
dzust whenever I pleash.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

<p>“Don’t be silly, Toddie,” remonstrated
Mrs. Burton, in spite of a warning nudge
from her husband.</p>

<p>“How do you see them, Toddie?” asked
Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“Why, I duzst finks a fink about ’em, an’
den dey comezh wight inshide of my eyezh,
an’ I sees ’em. I see lotsh of peoples dat-a-way.
I sees AbrahammynIsaac, an’ Bliaff, an’ little
Dave, an’ de Hebrew children, an’ Georgie
Washitton hatchetin’ down his papa’s tree,
whenever I finks about ’em. Oh, dere goezh
a wabbit! Letsh stop an’ catch him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, let him go,” said Mr. Burton.
“Perhaps he’s going home to dinner, and his
family are all waiting at the table for him.”</p>

<p>“Gwacious!” said Toddie, opening his
eyes very wide and keeping silence for at
least two minutes. Then he said, “I saw a
wabbit family eatin’ dinner once. Dey had
a little bittie of a table, an’ little bitsh of
chairzh, an’ de papa wabbit ashkted a blessin’
an’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Toddie, Toddie, don’t tell fibs!” said
Mrs. Burton, as she again felt herself touched
by her husband’s elbow.</p>

<p>“Izn’t tellin’ fibs! An’ a little boy wabbit
said, ‘Papa, I wantsh a dwink.’s So his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
papa took a little tumbler, dzust about as big
as a fimble, an’ held a big leaf up sideways
so de dew would run off into de tumbler, an’
he gived it to the little boy wabbit. An’
when dey got done dinner, de mamma wabbit
gave each of de little boy wabbits a strawberry
to suck. An’ none of ’em had to be
told to put on de napkins, ’cause dey only
had one dwess, and dat was a color dat didn’t
show dyte, like mamma says I ought to
have.”</p>

<p>“Were all the little rabbits boys&mdash;no girls
at all?” asked Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“Yesh, dere was a little sister baby, but
she wazh too little to come to de table, so de
mamma wabbit held her in her lap and played
‘Little Pig Went to Market’s on her little bits
of toes. Den de sister-baby got tired, an’ de
mamma wabbit wocked it in a wockin’-tsair,
an’ sung to it ’bout&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Den de baby-wabbit got tired of its mamma,
an’ got down an’ cwept around on itsh handsh

on, instead of ugly old carpets. Say, do you
know I was a wabbit once?”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” said Mr. Burton. “Do tell
us about it.”</p>

<p>“Harry!” remonstrated Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“He believes it, my dear,” explained her
husband. “He has his ’weetly fanciful’
mood on now, that you were moaning for a
few moments ago. Go on, Toddie.”</p>

<p>“Why, I was a wabbit, and lived all by
myself in a hole froo de bottom of a tree. An’
sometimes uvver wabbits came to see me, an’
we all sat down on our foots an’ bowled our
ears to each uvver. Dogsh came to see me
sometimes, but I dzust let dem wing de bell
an’ didn’t ask ’em to come in. An’ den a
dzentleman came an’ asked me to help him
make little boysh laugh in a circus. So I
runned around de ring, and picked up men
an’ fings wif my tchunk&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Rabbits don’t have trunks, Toddie.”</p>

<p>“I know it, but I tyned into a ephalant.
An’ I got lotsh of hay an’ fings wif my tchunk,
an’ folks gave me lotsh of cakes an’ candies to
see me eat ’em wif my tchunk, an’ I was so
big I could hold ’em all, an’ I didn’t have any
mamma ephalant to say, ‘Too muts cake an’
candy will make you sick, Toddie.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>’”</p>

<p>“Anything more?” asked Mr. Burton.
“We can stand almost anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, I gotted to be a lion den, and had
to roar so much dat my froat gotted all
sandy, so I got turned into a little boy again,
an’ I was awful hungry. I guesh ’twas djust
now.”</p>

<p>“Can you resist that hint, my dear?” Mr.
Burton asked. His wife, with a sigh, opened
a basket and gave a piece of cake to Toddie,
who remarked:</p>

<p>“Dish izh to pay me for tellin’ de troof
about all dem fings, izhn’t it?”</p>

<p>About this time the party reached Little
Falls, and Budge said:</p>

<p>“I suppose lunch’ll be the first thing?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Burton; “we won’t lunch
until our usual hour.”</p>

<p>“But you can have all the drinks you
want,” said Mr. Burton. “There’s a whole
river full of water.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t feel as if I’d ever be thirsty
again,” said Budge. “But I wish Terry was
here to swim in after sticks. You do it,
won’t you? You play dog an’ I’ll play
Uncle Harry an’ throw things to you.”</p>

<p>By this time Toddie had sought the water’
edge, and, taking a stooping position, looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
for fish. The shelving stone upon which he
stood was somewhat moist and Toddie was
so intent on his search that he stooped forward
considerably. Suddenly there was
heard a splash and a howl, and Toddie was
seen in the river, in water knee-deep. To
rescue him was the work of only a moment,
but to stop his tears was no such easy matter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p211.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">SUDDENLY HEARD A SPLASH AND A HOWL</div>
</div>

<p>“What is to be done?” exclaimed Mrs.
Burton.</p>

<p>“Take off his shoes and stockings and let
him run barefooted,” said Mr. Burton. “The
day is warm, so he can’t catch cold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Toddie, “Izh I goin’ to
be barefoot all day? I wishes dish river
wazh wight by our housh; I’d tumble in every
day. Budgie, Budgie, if you wantsh fun
dzust go tumble splash into de river.”</p>

<p>But Budge had strolled away, and was
tugging at some moss in a crevice of rock.
Here his aunt found him, and he explained,
toiling as he talked:</p>

<p>“I thought&mdash;this&mdash;would make such&mdash;a&mdash;lovely
cushion for&mdash;for you to sit on.”</p>

<p>The last word and the final tug were concurrent
and the moss gave way; so did Budge,
and with a terrific scream, for a little snake
had made his home under the moss, and was
expressing indignation, in his own way, at
being disturbed.</p>

<p>“I won’t never do nothin’ for nobody
again,” screamed Budge. “I’ll see that
snake every time I shut my eyes, now.”</p>

<p>“You poor, dear little fellow,” said Mrs.
Burton, caressing him tenderly. “I wish
Aunt Alice could do something to make you
forget it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t, unless&mdash;unless, maybe, a
piece of pie would do it. It wouldn’t do any
harm to try, I s’pose?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton hurried to unpack a pie, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
her husband remarked that Budge was born
to be a diplomatist. Looking suspiciously
about, for fear that Toddie might espy
Budge’s prescription, and devise some ailment
which it would exactly suit, she discovered
that Toddie was out of sight.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s gone, Harry! Hurry and find
him. Perhaps he’s gone above the Falls. I
do wish we had gone further down the river!”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton took a lively double-quick up
and along the bank of the river, but could see
nothing of his nephew.</p>

<p>After two or three minutes, however, above
the roar of the falling water, he heard a shrill
voice singing over and over again a single line
of an old Methodist hymn,</p>

<p>
“Roar&mdash;ing riv&mdash;ers, migh&mdash;ty fountains!”<br />
</p>

<p>Following the sound, he peered over the
bank, and saw Toddie in a sunny nook of
rocks just below the Falls, and in a very
ecstasy of delight. He would hold out his
hands as if to take the fall itself; then he
would throw back his head and render his line
with more force; then he would dance frantically
about, as if his little body was unable to
comfortably contain the great soul within it.</p>

<p>Suddenly coming up the sands below the
cliff appeared Mrs. Burton, whose appre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>hensions
had compelled her to join in the
search.</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Alish!” exclaimed Toddie, discovering
his aunt, and hurrying to grasp her
hand in both of his own; “dzust see de water
dance! Do you see all de lovely lights dat
de Lord’s lit in it? Don’t you wiss you could
get in it, an’ fly froo it, an’ have it shake itself
all over you, an’ shake yourself in it, an’
shake it all off of you, an’ den fly into it aden?
Deresh placesh like dis up in hebben. I
know, ’cauzh I saw ’em&mdash;one time I did. An’
all the andzels staid around ’em, an’ flew in
an’ out, an’ froo an’ froo’s an’ laughed like
everyfing!”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton concealed all of himself but his
eyes and hat to observe the impending conflict
of ideas; but no conflict ensued, for
Mrs. Burton snatched her nephew and kissed
him soundly. But Toddie wriggled away,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Don’t do dat, or I’ll get some uvver eyes
when I don’t want ’em.”</p>

<p>How long Toddie’s ecstasy might have endured
the Burtons never knew, for a clatter
of horse-hoofs on the road attracted Mr. Burton,
and, looking hastily back, he beheld one
of his brother’s horses galloping wildly back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
towards Hillcrest, while, just letting go of a
reinstrap, and enlivening the dust of the roadway,
was the form of the boy Budge, whose
voice rose
shrilly above
the thunder of
the falling
waters.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p215.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">BUDGE ENLIVENED THE DUST OF THE ROADWAY</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Burton
attempted first to catch the horse, but the
animal shied successfully and had so clear a
stretch of roadway before him that humanity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
soon had Mr. Burton’s heart for its own and
he hurried to the assistance of Budge.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;boo-hoo&mdash;was just goin’ to lead
the&mdash;boo-hoo-hoo&mdash;horse down to water
like&mdash;boo-hoo-hoo&mdash;ah&mdash;like papa does,
when he&mdash;oh! how my elbow hurts!&mdash;just
pulled away an’ went off. An’ I caught
the strap to stop him, an’&mdash;oh! he just
pulled me along on my mouth in the dirt
about ten miles. I swallowed all the dirt
I could, but I guess I’ve got a mouthful
left.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton hurriedly unharnessed the
other horse, and started, riding bareback, in
search of the runaway, while his wife, who
had intuitively scented trouble in the air,
hurried up the cliff with Toddie, and led both
boys to the shadow of the carriage, with instructions
to be perfectly quiet until their
uncle returned.</p>

<p>“Can’t we talk?” asked Toddie.</p>

<p>“Oh, not unless you need to for some particular
purpose,” said Mrs. Burton, who, like
most other people in trouble, fought most
earnestly against any form of diversion
which should keep her from the extremity of
worry. “Can’t little boys’s mouths ever be
quiet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said Budge, “when there’
something in ’em to keep ’em still.”</p>

<p>In utter desperation Mrs. Burton unpacked
all the baskets and told the children to help
themselves. As for her, she sought the roadside
and gazed earnestly for her husband.
Wearied at last by hope deferred she returned
to the carriage to find that the boys
had eaten all the pie and cake, drank the
milk and ate the sugar which were to have
formed part of some delicious coffee which
Mr. Burton was to have made <i>à la militaire</i>,
and had battered into shapelessness a box of
sardines by attempting to open it with a
stone.</p>

<p>“You bad boys!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton.
“Now what will your poor uncle have to eat
when he comes back all tired, hungry, and
thirsty and all because of your mischief,
Budge.”</p>

<p>“Why, we haven’t touched the crackers,
Aunt Alice,” said Budge.” They’re what he
gave us when we said we was awful hungry,
an’ there’s a whole river full of water to
drink, like he told us about when he thought
we was thirsty.”</p>

<p>The information did not seem to console
Mrs. Burton, who ventured to the roadside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
with the feeling that she could endure it to
know that her husband was starving if she
could only see him safe back again. The moments
dragged wearily on, the boys grew restive
and then cross, and at about three in the
afternoon, Mr. Burton reappeared. The runaway
had nearly reached home, breaking a
shoe <i>en route</i>, and his captor had found it
necessary to seek a blacksmith. The horse
he rode had evidently never been broken to
the saddle, and many had been the jeers of
the village boys at his rider’s apparent mismanagement.
All he knew now was that
he was ravenously hungry.</p>

<p>“And the boys have eaten everything but
the bread and crackers,” gasped Mrs. Burton.
“I’ve not eaten a mouthful.”</p>

<p>“Goodness!” exclaimed Mr. Burton, feeling
the boys’s waist-belts; “didn’t they throw
anything away?”</p>

<p>“Only down our froats.” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go to the nearest hotel,” said
the disappointed man,” and get a nice
dinner.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go too,” said Budge. “Pie an’
cake an’ all such things don’t fill people a bit
on picnics.”</p>

<p>“Then a little emptiness will be best for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
you,” said Mr. Burton. “You remain here
with your aunt.”</p>

<p>“Well, hurry up, then,” said Budge.
“Here’s the afternoon half gone, Aunt Alice
says, and you haven’t made us a whistle, or
taken us in swimmin’, or let us catch fishes,
or throwed big stones in the water for us, or
anythin’.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton departed with becoming meekness,
his nephew’s admonition ringing in his
ears, while the boys hovered solemnly about
their aunt until she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Why are you acting so strangely, boys?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we feel kind o’s forlorn, an’ we want
to be comforted,” said Budge.</p>

<p>“Will you comfort poor Uncle Harry when
he comes back?” asked Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Why, I heard him once tell you that you
were his comfort,” said Budge; “and comforts
oughtn’t to be mixed up if folks is goin’
to get all the good out of ’em; that’s what
papa says.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton kissed both nephews effusively
and asked them what she could do for them.</p>

<p>“I doe know,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>Inspiration came to Mrs. Burton’s assistance
and she said,</p>

<p>“You may both do exactly as you please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span></p>

<p>“Hooray!” shouted Budge.</p>

<p>“An’ you izhn’t goin’ to say ‘Don’t!’s a
single bit?” Toddie asked.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed both brothers, in unison.</p>

<p>Then they clasped hands and walked
slowly and silently away. They even stopped
to kiss each other, while Mrs. Burton looked
on in silent amazement.</p>

<p>Was this really the result of not keeping a
watchful eye upon children?</p>

<p>The boys rambled quietly along, sat down
on a large rock, put their arms around each
other and gazed silently at the scenery.
They sat there until their uncle returned and
their aunt pointed out the couple to him.
Then the adults insensibly followed the example
set by the juveniles, and on the banks
of the river sweet peace ruled for an hour,
until old Sol, who once stood still to look at
a fight but never paused to contemplate
humanity conquered by the tender influences
of nature, warned the party that it was time
to return.</p>

<p>“It’s time to go, boys,” said Mr. Burton,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>The words snapped the invisible thread
that had held the children in exquisite cap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>tivity,
and they were boys again in an
instant, though not without a wistful glance
at the Eden they were leaving.</p>

<p>“Now, Uncle Harry,” said Budge, “there’
always one thing that’s got to be done before
a picnic an’ a ride is just right, an’ that is for
me to drive the horses.”</p>

<p>“An’ me to hold de whip,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think you’ve done your whole duty
to-day&mdash;both of you,” said Mr. Burton, instinctively
grasping his lines more tightly.</p>

<p>“But we don’t,” said Budge, “an’ we know.
Goin’ up the mountain papa always lets us do
it an’ he says the horses always know the
minute we take ’em in hand.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder. Well, here’s a hill;
take hold!”</p>

<p>Budge seized the reins, and Toddie took
the whip from its socket. The noble animals
at once sustained their master’s statement,
for they began to prance in a manner utterly
unbecoming quiet family horses. Mrs. Burton
clutched her husband’s arm, and Mr.
Burton prudently laid his own hand upon the
loop of the reins.</p>

<p>The crest of the hill was reached, Mr. Burton
took the reins from the hand of his
nephew, but Toddie made one final clutch at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
departing authority by giving the off horse
a spirited cut. Tom Lawrence would never
own a horse that needed a touch of the whip,
though that emblem of authority always
adorned his carriage. When, therefore, this
unfamiliar attention greeted them the horse
who was struck became gloriously indignant,
and his companion sympathized with him
and the heels of both animals shot high in
the air and then, at a pace which nothing
could arrest, the horses dashed down the
rocky, rugged road. The top of a boulder,
whose side had been cleanly washed, lay in
the path of the carriage, and Mr. Burton gave
the opposite rein a hasty twist about his
hand as he tried to draw to the side of the
road. But what was a boulder, that equine
indignation should regard it? The stone
was directly in front and in line of the wheels.
Mrs. Burton prepared for final dissolution by
clasping her husband tightly with one arm,
while with the other she clutched at the reins.
The boys started the negro hymn, “Oh, De
Rocky Road to Zion,” the wheels struck the
boulder, four people described curves in air
and ceased only when their further progress
was arrested by some bushes at the roadside.
The carriage righted itself and was hurried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
home by the horses, while a party of pedestrians,
two of whom were very merry and
two utterly reticent, completed their journey
on foot, pausing only to bathe scratched
faces at a brookside. And when, an hour
later, two little boys had been prepared for
bed, and their temporary guardians were
alternately laughing and complaining over
the incidents of the day, a voice was heard at
the head of the stairs, saying:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p222.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FURTHER PROGRESS WAS ARRESTED</div>
</div>

<p>“Uncle Harry, are we going to finish the
picnic to-morrow? ’Cause we didn’t get half
through to-day. There’s lots of picnicky
things that we didn’t get a chance to think
about.”</p>

<p>And another voice shouted:</p>

<p>“An’ letsh take more lunch wif us. I’zhe
been awful hungwy all day long!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>“Only three more days,” soliloquized
Mrs. Burton, when the departure of
her husband for New York and the disappearance
of the boys gave her a quiet moment
to herself. “Three more days, and
then peace&mdash;and a life-long sense of defeat!
And by whom? By two mere infants&mdash;in
years. I erred in not taking them singly.
When they are together it’s impossible to
take their minds from their own childish affairs
long enough to impress them with larger
sense and better ways. But I didn’t take
them singly, and I have talked, and oh&mdash;stupidest
of women!&mdash;I’ve blundered upon
my husband for my principal listener. He
does get along with them better than I do,
and the exasperating thing about it is that he
seems to do it without the slightest effort.
How is it? They cling to him, obey him,
sit by the roadside for an hour before train
time just to catch the first glimpse of him,
while I&mdash;am I growing uninteresting? Many
women do after they marry, but I didn’t
think that I”&mdash;here Mrs. Burton extracted a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
tiny mirror from a vase on the mantel&mdash;“that
I could be made stupid by marrying a
loving old merry heart like Harry!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton scrutinized her lineaments intently.
A wistful earnestness stole into her
face as she studied it, and it softened every
line. Suddenly but softly a little arm stole
about her neck, and a little voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice, why don’t you always look
that way? There! Now you’re stoppin’ it.
Big folks is just like little boys, ain’t they?
Mamma says it’s never safe to tell us we’re
good, ’cause we go an’ stop it right away.”</p>

<p>“When did you come in, Budge? How did
you come so softly? Have you been listening?
Don’t you know it is very impolite to
listen to people when they’re not talking to
you? Why, where are your shoes and
stockings?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Budge,” I took ’em off so’&mdash;so’
to get some cake for a little tea-party
without makin’ a noise about it! You say
our little boots make an awful racket. But
say, why don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why don’t I what?” asked Mrs. Burton,
her whole train of thought whisking out of
sight at lightning speed.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you always look like you did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
a minute ago? If you did, I wouldn’t ever
play or make trouble a bit. I’d just sit still
all the time, and do nothin’ but look at you.”</p>

<p>“How did I look, Budge?” asked Mrs.
Burton, taking the child into her arms.</p>

<p>“Why, you looked as if&mdash;as if&mdash;well, I
don’t ’zactly know. You looked like papa’
picture of Jesus’s mamma does, after you look
at it a long time an’ nobody is there to bother
you. I never saw anybody else look that
way ’xcept my mamma, an’ when she does it
I don’t ever say a word, else mebbe she’ll
stop.”</p>

<p>“You can have the cake you came for,”
said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“I don’t want any cake,” said Budge, with
an impatient movement. “I don’t want any
tea-party. I want to stay with you, an’ I
want you to talk to me, ’cause you’re beginnin’
to look that way again.” Here Budge
nearly strangled his aunt in a tight embrace,
and kissed her repeatedly.</p>

<p>“You darling little fellow,” asked Mrs.
Burton, while returning his caresses, “do you
know why I looked as I did? I was wondering
why you and Toddie love your Uncle
Harry so much better than you love me, and
why you always mind him and disobey me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

<p>Budge was silent for a moment or two,
then he sighed and answered:</p>

<p>“’Cause.”</p>

<p>“Because of what?” asked Mrs. Burton.
“You would make me very happy if you were
to explain it to me.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">“WELL,” SAID BUDGE, “CAUSE YOU’RE DIFFERENT.”</div>
</div>

<p>“Well,” said Budge, “’cause you’re different.”</p>

<p>“But, Budge, I know a great many people
who are not like each other, but I love them
equally well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

<p>“They ain’t uncles and aunts, are they?”</p>

<p>“No, but what has that to do with it?”</p>

<p>“And they’re not folks you have to mind,
are they?” continued Budge.</p>

<p>“N&mdash;&mdash;no,” said Mrs. Burton, descrying a
dim light afar off.</p>

<p>“Do they want you to do things their way?”</p>

<p>“Some of them do.”</p>

<p>“An’ do you do it?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I do.”</p>

<p>“You don’t unless you want to, do you?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Well, neither do I,” said Budge. “But
when Uncle Harry wants me to do somethin’,
why somehow or other I want to do it myself
after a while. I don’t know why, but I
do. An’ I don’t always, when you tell me to.
I love you ever so much when you ain’t tellin’
me things, but when you are, then they ain’t
ever what I want to do. That’s all I know
’bout it. ’Xcept, he don’t want me to do
such lots of things as you do. He likes to
see us enjoy ourselves; but sometimes I think
you don’t. We can’t be happy only our way,
an’ our way seems to be like Uncle Harry’,
an’ yours ain’t.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton mused, and gradually her lips
twitched back into their natural lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<p>“There&mdash;you ’re stoppin’ lookin’ that way,”
said Budge, sighing and straightening himself.
“I guess I do want the cake an’ the
tea-party.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go, Budgie, dear,” exclaimed Mrs.
Burton, clasping the boy tightly. “When
any one teaches you anything that you want
very much to know doesn’t it make you
happy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes&mdash;lots,” said Budge.</p>

<p>“Well, then, if you try, perhaps you can
teach Aunt Alice something that she wants
very much to know.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Budge. “A little boy
teach a grown folks lady? I guess I’ll stay.”</p>

<p>“I want to understand all about this difference
between your Uncle Harry and me,”
continued Mrs. Burton. “Do you think you
minded him very well last summer?”</p>

<p>“That’s too long ago for me to remember,”
said Budge “But I didn’t ever mind him
unless I wanted to, or else had to, an’ when
I had to an’ didn’t want to I didn’t love him
a bit. I talked to papa about it when we got
back home again, an’ he said ’twas ’cause
Uncle Harry didn’t know us well enough an’
didn’t always have time to find out all about
us. Then they had a talk about it&mdash;papa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
and Uncle Harry did, in the library one day.
I know they did, ’cause I was playin’ blocks
in a corner, an’ I just stopped a-playin’ an’
listened to ’em. An’ all at once papa said,
‘Little pitchers!’s an’ said I’d oblige him very
much if I’d go to the store and buy him a
box of matches. But I just listened a minute
after I went out of the room, until I heard
Uncle Harry say he’d been a donkey. I
knew he was mistaken about that, so I went
back an’ told him he hadn’t ever been any
animals but what’s in a menagerie, an’ then
they both laughed an’ went out walkin’,
an’ I don’t know what they said after that.
Only Uncle Harry’s been awful good to me
ever since, though sometimes I bother him
when I don’t mean to.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton released one arm from her
nephew and rested her head thoughtfully upon
her hand. Budge looked up and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“There! You’re looking that way again.
Say, Aunt Alice, don’t Uncle Harry love you
lots an’ lots when you look so?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton recalled evidence of such experiences,
but before she could say so a small
curly head came cautiously around the edge
of the door, and then it was followed by the
whole of Toddie, who exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p>“I fink you’s a real mean bruvver, Budgie!
De tea-party’s been all ready for you an’ de
cake till I had to eat up all de strawberries to
keep de nasty little ants from eatin’ ’em. I
yet up de cabbage-leaf plate dey was in, too,
to keep me from gettin’ hungrier.”</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Budge, springing from
his aunt’s lap.” That’s just the way, whenever
I’m lovin’ to anybody, somethin’ always
goes and happens.”</p>

<p>“Is that all you care for your aunt, Budge?”
asked Mrs. Burton. “Is a tea-party worth
more than me?”</p>

<p>Budge reflected for a moment. “Well,”
said he, “didn’t you cry when your tea-party
was spoiled last week on your burfday? To
be sure, your tea-party was bigger than ours,
but then you’re a good deal bigger than we,
too, an’ I haven’t cried a bit.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton saw the point and was mentally
unable to avoid it. The view was not a
pleasant one, and grew more humiliating the
longer it was presented. It was, perhaps, to
banish it that she rose from her chair, brought
from a closet in the dining-room some of the
coveted cake and gave a piece to each boy,
saying:</p>

<p>“It isn’t that Aunt Alice cares so much for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
her cake, dears, that she doesn’t like you to
have it between meals, but because it is bad
for little boys to eat such heavy food excepting
at their regular meals. There are grown
people who were once happy little children,
but now they are very cross all the while because
their stomachs are disordered by
having eaten when they should not, and
eating things which are richer and heavier
than their bodies can use.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Budge, crowding the contents
of his mouth into his cheeks, “we can
eat somethin’ plainer an’ lighter to mix up
with ’em inside of us. I should think charlotte-russe
or whipped cream would be about
the thing. Shall I ask the cook to fix some?”</p>

<p>“No! Exercise would be better than anything
else. I think you had better take a
walk.”</p>

<p>“Up to Hawkshnesht Rock?” Toddie suggested.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” exclaimed Budge. “An’ you
come with us, Aunt Alice; perhaps you’ll
look that way again; that way, you know,
an’ I wouldn’t like to lose any of it.”</p>

<div class="caption">PRETENDING TO BE HORSES</div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Burton could not decline so delicate
an invitation, and soon the trio were on the
road, Mrs. Burton walking leisurely on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
turf by the side, while the boys ploughed
their way through the dust of the middle of
the road, pretending to be horses and succeeding
so far as to create a dust-cloud which
no team of horses could have excelled.</p>

<p>“Boys, boys!” shouted Mrs. Burton. “Is
no one going to be company for me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll be your gentleman,” said Budge.</p>

<p>“I’ll help,” said Toddie, and both boys
hurried to their aunt’s side.</p>

<p>“Little boys,” said Mrs. Burton, gently,
“do you know that your mamma and papa
have to pay a high price for the fun you have
in kicking up dust? Look at your clothes!
They must be sent to the cleaner’s before
they will ever again be fit to wear where respectable
people can see you.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Budge, “they’re just right to
give to poor little boys, and just think how
glad they’ll be! I guess they’ll thank the
Lord ’cause we run in the dust.”</p>

<p>“The poor little boys would have been just
as glad to have them while they were clean,”
said Mrs. Burton, “and the kindness would
have cost your papa and mamma no more.”</p>

<p>“Well, then&mdash;then&mdash;then I guess we’d better
talk about something else,” said Budge,
“an’ go ’long froo the woods instead of in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
road. Oh&mdash;h&mdash;h!” he continued, kicking
through some grass under the chestnut-trees
by the roadside, “here’s a chestnut! Is it
chestnut-time again already?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, that’s one of last year’s nuts.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” exclaimed Budge; “I ought to
have known that. It’s dreadfully old-fashioned.”</p>

<p>“Old-fashioned?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s full of wrinkles, don’t you see;
like the face of Mrs. Paynter, an’ you say
she’s old-fashioned.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice,” said Toddie, “birch-trees
izh de only kind dat wearzsh Sunday clothes,
ain’t dey? Deyzh always all in white, like
me and Budgie, when we goes to Sunday-school.
Gwacious!” he exclaimed, as he
leaned against one of the birches and examined
its outer garments. “Deyzh Sunday
trees awful; dish one is singin’ a song! Dzust
come&mdash;hark!”</p>

<p>Though somewhat startled at the range of
Toddie’s imagination, and wondering what
incentive it had on the present occasion,
Mrs. Burton approached the tree, and solved
the mystery by hearing the breeze sighing
softly through the branches. She told Toddie
what caused the sound, and the child replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span></p>

<p>“Den it’s de Lord come down to sing in it,
’cauzh it’s got Sunday clothes on. Datsh it,
izhn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Toddie; the wind is only the
wind.”</p>

<p>“Why I always fought it wazh the Lord
a-talkin’, when the wind blowed. I guesh
somebody tolded me so, ’cauzh I fought dat
before I had many uvver finks.”</p>

<p>Up the mountain-road leisurely sauntered
Mrs. Burton, while her nephews examined
every large stone, boulder tree and hole in
the ground <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>The top of the hill was gained at last and
with a long-drawn “Oh!” both boys sat
down and gazed in delight at the extended
scene before them. Budge broke the silence
by asking:</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice, don’t you s’pose dear brother
Phillie, up in heaven, is lookin’ at all these
towns, an’ hills, an’ rivers, an’ things, just
like we are?”</p>

<p>“Very likely, dear.”</p>

<p>“Well, then he can see a good deal further
than we can. Do our spirits have new eyes
put in ’em when they get up to heaven?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Perhaps they merely
have their sight made better.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

<p>“Why, does spirits take deir old eyes wif
’em to hebben, an’ leave all de rest part of
’em in de deader?” asked Toddie.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton realized that she had been too
hasty in assuming knowledge of spiritual
physiognomy, and she endeavored to retract
by saying:</p>

<p>“Spiritual eyes and bodily eyes are different.”</p>

<p>“Does dust and choo-choo cinders ever
get into spirit eyes, an’ make little boy andzels
cry, and growed-up andzels say swear
wordsh?” asked Toddie.</p>

<p>“Certainly not. There’s no crying or
swearing in heaven.”</p>

<p>“Then what does angels do with the water
in their eyes, when they hear music that
makes ’em feel as if wind was blowin’ fro
’em?” asked Budge.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton endeavored to change the
subject of conversation to one with which
she was more familiar, by asking Budge if he
knew that there were hills a hundred times
as high as Hawksnest Rock.</p>

<p>“Goodness, no! Why, I should think you
could look right into heaven from the tops of
them. Can’t you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Burton, with some im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>patience
at the result of her attempt.” Besides,
their tops are covered with snow all the
time, and nobody can get up to them.”</p>

<p>“Then the little boy andzels can play
snowballs on ’em wifout no cross mans comin’
up an’ sayin’, ‘Don’t!’” said Toddie.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton tried again:</p>

<p>“See how high that bird is flying,” she
said, pointing to a hawk who was soaring
far above the hill.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Budge. “He can go up into
heaven whenever he wants to, ’cause he’s got
wings. I don’t know why birds have got
wings and little boys haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Little boys are already hard enough to
find when they’re wanted,” said Mrs. Burton.
“If they had wings they’d always be out of
sight. But what makes you little boys talk
so much about heaven to-day?”</p>

<p>“Oh, ’cause we’re up so much closer to it,
I suppose,” said Budge, “when were on a
high hill like this.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it must be nearly lunching
time?” asked Mrs. Burton, using, in despair,
the argument which has seldom failed
with healthy children.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Budge. “I always do.
Come on, Tod. Let’s go the quickest way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<p>The shortest way was by numerous short
cuts, with which the boys seemed perfectly
acquainted. One of these, however, was by
a steep incline, and Budge, perhaps snuffing
the lunch-basket afar off, descended so rapidly
that he lost his balance, fell forward,
tried to recover himself, failed, and slipped
rapidly through a narrow path which finally
ended in a gutter traversing it.</p>

<p>“Ow!” he exclaimed as he picked himself
up, and relieved himself of a mouthful of mud.
“Did you see my back come up an’ me walk
down the mountain on my mouth? I think
a snake would be ashamed of himself to see
how easy it was. I didn’t try a bit, I just
went slip, slop, bunk! to the bottom.”</p>

<p>“An’ you didn’t get scolded for dytyin’
your clothes, either.” said Toddie. “Let’
sing ‘Gloly, Gloly, Hallehelyah.”</p>

<p>The subject of dirt upon juvenile raiment
began to trouble the mind of Mrs. Burton.
Could it be possible that children had a
natural right to dirtier clothing than adults,
and without incurring special blame? Was
dirtiness sinful? Well, yes&mdash;that is, it was
disgusting, and whatever was disgusting was
worse in the eyes of Mrs. Burton than what
was sinful. Could children be as neat as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
adults? Had they either the requisite sense,
perception or the acquired habit of carefulness?
Again Mrs. Burton went into a study
of the brownest description, while the children
improved her moments
of preoccupation to do all
sorts of things which would
have seemed dreadful to
their aunt but were delightful
to themselves. At length,
however, they reached
the Burton dining-table,
and managed
a series of rapid disappearances
for
whatever was
upon it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">BUDGE LOST HIS BALANCE</div>
</div>

<p>“Aunt Alice,”
said Budge,
after finishing
his meal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
“what are you going to do to make us happy
this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Mrs. Burton,” I shall allow
you to amuse yourselves. I shall be quite
busy superintending the baking. Our cook
has only recently come to us, you know, and
she may need some help from me.”</p>

<p>“I fought bakin’ wazh alwaysh in mornin’?”
said Toddie. “My mamma says dat
only lazy peoplesh bakesh in affernoonzh.”</p>

<p>“The cook was too busily engaged otherwise
this morning, Toddie,” said Mrs. Burton.
“Besides, people bake mornings because they
are compelled to; for, when they put bread to
rise overnight, they must bake in the morning.
But there is a new kind of yeast now
that lets us make our bread whenever we
want to, within a couple of hours from the
time of beginning.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, Aunt Alice,” said Budge,
“that we can bake? We can&mdash;real nice.
We’ve helped mamma make pies an’ cakes
lots of times, only hers are big ones an’ ours
are baby ones.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I am to construe that remark
as a hint that you would like to help me?”
said Mrs. Burton. “If you will do only what
you are told, you may go to the kitchen with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
me; but listen&mdash;the moment you give the
cook or me the least bit of trouble, out you
shall go.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goody, goody!” shouted Toddie.
“An’ can we have tea-parties on de kitchen-table
as fast as we bake fings?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Come on. My hands won’t be still a bittie,
I wantsh to work so much. How many
kindsh of pies is you goin’ to make?”</p>

<p>“None at all.”</p>

<p>“Gwacious! I shouldn’t fink you’d call it
bakin’-day den. Izhn’t you goin’ to make
noffin’ but ole nashty bwead?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can find a way for you to make
a little cake or some buns,” said Mrs. Burton,
relenting.</p>

<p>“Well, that would be kind o’s bakin’-day
like; but my hands is gettin’ still again awful
fasht.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton led the way to the kitchen,
and the preparation of the staff of life was
begun by the new cook, with such assistance
as a small boy wedged closely under each
elbow, and two inquiring faces hanging over
the very edge of the bread-pan.</p>

<p>“That don’t look very cakey,” remarked
Budge. “She ain’t put any powder into it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

<p>“This kind of bread needs no powder.
Baking-powders are used only in tea-biscuit.”</p>

<p>“When tea-biscuits goes in de oven deysh
little bits of flat fings,” said Toddie&mdash;“deysh
little bits of flat fings, but when dey comes
out dey’s awful big an’ fat. What makes ’em
bake big?”</p>

<p>“That’s what the powder is put in for,”
said Mrs. Burton. “They’d be little, tasteless
things if it weren’t for the powder.
Bridget, work some sweetening with a little
of the dough, so the boys can have some
buns.”</p>

<p>Both boys escorted the cook to the pantry
for sugar, and back again to the table, and
got their noses as nearly as possible under the
roller with which the sugar was crushed, and
they superintended the operation of working
it into the dough, and then Mrs. Burton
found some very small pans in the center of
which the boys put single buns which they
were themselves allowed to shape. A happy
inspiration came to Mrs. Burton; she
brought a few raisins from the pantry and
placed one upon the center of each tiny bun
as it was made, and she was rewarded by a
dual shriek of delight.</p>

<p>“Stop, Toddie!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
suddenly noticing that Toddie was shaping
his dough by rolling it vigorously between
his hands, as little boys treat clay while attempting
to make marbles. “If you press
your dough hard it will never bake light in
the world.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p243.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">TWO INQUIRING FACES HANGING OVER THE BREAD-PAN</div>
</div>

<p>“You mean de hot won’t make it grow
big?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Datzh too baddy. It’h awful too baddy,”
said Toddie “Dere won’t be as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
of ’em to eat. Tell you what&mdash;put some
powder in it to help the uvvr swelly stuff.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that won’t do any good.”</p>

<p>“Might twy it,” Toddie suggested. “Ah&mdash;h&mdash;h&mdash;Budgie’
makin’ some of my buns
baldheaded.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Mrs. Burton asked.</p>

<p>“He’s takin’ de raisins off de tops of ’em,
an’ dat makes ’em baldheaded.”</p>

<p>“I was only keepin’ ’em from lookin’ all
alike,” explained Budge, hastily putting the
raisins where they could not be affected by
any future proceedings. “Don’t you see,
Toddie, you’ll have two kinds of buns
now?”</p>

<p>“Don’t want two kindsh,” cried Toddie.
“I’ze a good mind to cut you open an’ take
dem heads back again.”</p>

<p>Budge was reproved by his aunt, and Toddie
was pacified by the removal of raisins
from his brother’s buns to his own. Then
some of the little pans were placed in the
vacant space in the oven, and during the
next fifteen minutes Mrs. Burton was implored
at least twenty times to see if they
weren’t almost done. When, finally baked,
Toddie’s were as small as bullets and about
as hard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<p>“Put some powder in de rest of dem,”
pleaded Toddie.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t do the slightest bit of good,”
said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>Further entreaties led to a conflict between
will and authority, after which Toddie
sulked and disappeared, carrying one of his
precious pans with him. When he returned
the baking was over, and the oven-door was
open.</p>

<p>“Izhe a-goin’ to bake dis uvver one any
how,” said Toddie, putting the single remaining
pan into the oven and closing the door.
“Say, Aunt Alice,” he continued, his good,
nature returning, “now fix dat tea-party we
was goin’ to have wif our own fings. You
can come to the table wif us if you want to.”</p>

<p>“Only, don’t you think she ought to bring
somethin’ with her?” asked Budge. “That’
the way little boys’s tea-parties out of doors
always are.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton herself rendered a satisfactory
decision upon this question by making a
small pitcher of lemonade: the table was
drawn as near the door as possible, to avoid
the heat of the room; Budge escorted his
aunt to the seat of honor, and, when all
were seated, he asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p>“Do you think these is enough things to
ask a blessin’ over? Sometimes we do it, an’
sometimes we don’t, ’cordin’ to how much
we’ve got.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton rapidly framed a small explanatory
lecture on the principle under-lying
the custom of grace at meals; but whatever
may have been its merits the boys never
had an opportunity of judging, for suddenly
a loud report startled the party, a piece of
the stove flew violently across the room and
broke against the wall, the stove-lids shivered
violently and the doors fell open; the poker,
which had lain on the stove, danced frantically,
and a small pan of some sort of fat,
such as some cooks have a fancy to be always
doing something with but never do it, was
shaken over and its burning contents began
to diffuse a sickening odor. The cook
dropped upon her knees, the party arose&mdash;Budge
roaring, Toddie screaming, and Mrs.
Burton very pale, while the cook gasped:</p>

<p>“The wather-back’s busted!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton disengaged herself from her
clinging nephews and approached the range
cautiously. There was no sign of water and
the back of the range was undisturbed; even
the fire was not disarranged.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">A LOUD REPORT STARTLED THE PARTY</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span></p>

<p>“It isn’t the water-back,” said Mrs. Burton,
“nor the fire. What could it have
been?”</p>

<p>“An’ I belave, mum,” said the cook, “that
’twas the dhivil, savin’ yer prisince; an’,
saints presarve us! I ’ve heerd at home as how
he hated dese new ways of cookin’, because
dheres no foine place for him to sit in the
corner of, bad luck to him! It was the dhivil,
sure, mum. Did iver ye schmell the loike av
that?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton snuffed the air, and in spite of
the loathsome odor of burning grease she detected
a strong sulphurous odor.</p>

<p>“An’ he went and tookted my last bun wif
him too,” complained Toddie, who had been
cautiously approaching the oven in which he
had placed his pan. “Bad ole debbil! I
fought he didn’t have noffin but roasted
peoples at hizh tea-parties!”</p>

<p>The whole party was too much agitated
and mystified to pursue their investigations
further. The fire was allowed to die out and
Mrs. Burton hurried up-stairs and to the front
of the house with the children.</p>

<p>Mr. Burton on his way home was met by
his wife and nephews, and heard a tale which
had reached blood-curdling proportions. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
descent to the scene of the disaster was reluctantly
consented to by his wife; but he
was unable to discover the cause of the accident,
and he succeeded in getting his hands
shockingly dirty. He hurried to his bed-chamber
to wash them, and in a moment he
roared from the head of the stairs:</p>

<p>“Boys, which of you has been up here to-day?”</p>

<p>There was no response for a moment; then
Budge shouted:</p>

<p>“Not me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton looked inquiringly at Toddie,
and the young gentleman averted his eyes.
Then Mr. Burton hurried down-stairs, looked
at both boys and asked: “Why did you meddle
with my powder-flask, Toddie?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why&mdash;why, Aunt Alice wouldn’t
put no powder in my buns to make ’em light
after I rolled ’em heavy&mdash;said ’twouldn’t do
’em no good. But my papa says ’tain’t
never no harm to try, so I dzust wented and
gotted some powder out of your brass bottle
dat’s hanging on your gun, an’ I didn’t say
nuffin’ to nobody, ’cauzh I wanted to s’prise
’em. An’ while I was waitin’ for it to get
done, bad ole debbil came an’ hookted it.
Guesh it must have been real good else he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
wouldn’t have done it, ’cauzh he’s such a
smart fief he can steal de nicest fings he
wantsh&mdash;whole cakeshop windows full.”</p>

<p>“How did you mix it with the dough?&mdash;how
much did you take?” Mrs. Burton demanded.</p>

<p>“Didn’t mix it at all,” said Toddie; “dzush
pourded it on de pan azh full azh I could.
You’d fink I’d have to, if you tried to eat one
of my buns dat didn’t have no powder in.
Gwacious! wasn’t dey hard? I couldn’t
bite ’em a bit&mdash;I dzust had to swallow ’em
whole.”</p>

<p>“Umph!” growled Mr. Burton. “And do
you know who the devil&mdash;the little devil was
that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Harry!”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, the truth appears to be
this; your nephew&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Your nephew, Mr. Burton.”</p>

<p>“Well, my&mdash;our nephew, put into the oven
this afternoon about enough of gunpowder
to charge a six-pounder shell, and the heat of
the oven gradually became too much for it.”</p>

<p>Toddie had listened to this conversation
with an air of anxious inquiry, and at last
timidly asked:</p>

<p>“Wazhn’t it de right kind of powder? I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
fought it wazh, ’cauzh it makes everyfing else
light when it goezh off.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose your method of training
will ever prevail against that boy’s logic, my
dear?” asked Mrs. Burton. “And if it won’t,
what will?”</p>

<p>“I won’t put so much in nexsht time,” said
Toddie, “’cauzh ’tain’t no good to twy a fing
an’ den have de tryin’ stuff go an’ take de
fing all away from you an’ get so mad as to
bweak stoves to bits an’ scare little boysh
an’ Aunt Alishes ’most to deff.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>“Ow, Ow, OW!” was the réveillé of the
Burton family on the next morning,
and it was sounded from the room of the
juvenile guests.</p>

<p>“Another fight, I suppose,” grunted Mr.
Burton in his room, “and as I’m dressed I
might as well go and see which one was
whipped and which ought to be.”</p>

<p>Arrived at his nephew’s room, Mr. Burton
found Toddie curled up in the middle of the
bed sound asleep, and his brother with his
eyes shut, but wriggling restlessly.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Budge?” asked Mr.
Burton.</p>

<p>“My side hurts, where I bunked it, stoppin’
in the gutter, when I slid down the mountain,”
drawled Budge. “An’ the hard part of the
bed comes up to it and hurts it. As soon as I
find a soft part of the bed, the hard part begins
to come up through it and hurt me.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you were to turn and lie on the
other side?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;why&mdash;I&mdash;then&mdash;I&mdash;” stammered
Budge, arising slowly and rubbing his eyes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
“then I wouldn’t have any soft parts to look
for, an’ I wouldn’t have anythin’ to do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” Mr. Burton muttered, turning
abruptly and quitting the room; “the faculty
for hugging misery isn’t born in people; not
at all! I’ll have to tell this to our parson. A
lot of good people that need it might get a
sound thrashing over somebody else’s shoulders.”</p>

<p>At the breakfast table Budge ate quietly,
but with characteristic American industry,
before he said:</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice, too much tea isn’t good for
people, is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! It’s very bad.”</p>

<p>“And one cup is enough for pretty much
every one, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes my papa drinks three or four.”</p>

<p>“That must be when he has a headache.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, ’tis. People need more then,
don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you think a sideache is as bad
as a headache?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton guessed the sequel, but refrained
from replying.</p>

<p>“An awful sideache,” Budge continued,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
“when a little boy’s side has been bumped
real hard by a great big mountain side.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton bit her upper lip and reached
for Budge’s mug, which the young man accommodatingly
pushed toward her, saying:</p>

<p>“And I think when it’s a little boy that’
got to drink it ’cause he’s sick, there ought to
be lots an’ lots of sugar
in it, to keep it from being
too strong.”</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/p253.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“TOO MUCH TEA ISN’T GOOD
FOR PEOPLE, IS IT?”</div>
</div>

<p>Budge’
mug was
filled according
to
his liking,
Mr. Burton’s eyes dancing
over it so busily
that they could not
stop when Mrs. Burton
accidentally detected
them. A few moments
of adult silence was the
natural result, and the boys improved the
opportunity to disappear without being
questioned; after which Mr. Burton, starting
for the city, gave shortly the monosyllable
“No!” in reply to the question whether he
should bring anything home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Burton found herself soon in the depth
of another inspection of her career as a manager
of children, and began to realize that
she was as faulty in being too indulgent as
she was in being too severe. Recalling the
many tricks of the children to overcome her
rules, she could not remember a single one at
which they had not succeeded, and the realization
of this was as mortifying to her sense
of duty as it was to her pride. To be firm
when her sense of humor was touched was a
phase of ability of which she found herself to
be as destitute as people usually are; but the
existence of such a failing she had never even
imagined before, and it doubled her sense of
responsibility and&mdash;humility.</p>

<p>But the latter quality soon was lost in one
which comes more naturally, and is always
fully developed&mdash;pride. What wouldn’t
she have given to have that breakfast-scene
to manage again? To think that she, who
had in every other department of life, discerned
sly attempts afar off, and successfully
circumvented them, should have been outwitted
by two very small boys! Oh, for just
one more attempt by either of them! Mrs.
Burton instinctively bit her lip until pain
caused her to stop. Upon this, at any rate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
she was determined&mdash;she would not only prevent
her nephews accomplishing their artfully
laid purposes, but she would explain to
them how dishonest such attempts were, and
endeavor to shame them into ingenuousness.</p>

<p>At this instant the sound of a wordy altercation,
momentarily growing livelier, floated
up from the kitchen windows, and Mrs. Burton
started to act as arbitrator.</p>

<p>“We want it. That’s why,” was heard
from Budge, as Mrs. Burton entered the
kitchen.</p>

<p>“Want what?” asked the mistress of the
house.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Budge, his face lighting with
the anticipation of assistance close at hand,
“we’ve found a big nest full of eggs in the
grass, a good way off, an’ we want to boil ’em
and eat ’em, and I’ve asked Bridget over an’
over again for a pail to boil ’em in, and all she
says is, ’Niver a bit.’”</p>

<p>“Which she is perfectly right in saying,”
said Mrs. Burton,” when, as I assume from
what I overheard as I came in, you did not
tell her what you wanted of the pail.”</p>

<p>“Well, I couldn’t help remembering what
you said to Uncle Harry the other evening&mdash;that
you had the most utter contempt for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
people that always wanted to know about
other people’s business. I don’t know what
’utter contempt’s means, but I thought, from
the way you said it, you meant folks who was
always askin’ questions about what other
folks was doin’.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton hastily took a small pail from
a shelf and gave it to Budge, who walked off
while his aunt, recollecting her good resolutions,
retired and wept despairingly. The
idea of letting two small children eat a lot of
eggs between meals! No one knew where
they were or how many eggs they had; probably
they had built a fire where no fire should
be, and what damage they were threatening
to property and life only Heaven knew. She
wished herself within the councils of Heaven;
she committed a dozen frightful heresies
while she wondered, but came back by necessity
to the virtue of resignation, for how to
find her nephews would have puzzled a head
more experienced than her own in the ways
of small boys.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p256.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“WHEN WE COOKED ’EM, WHAT DO YOU THINK?”</div>
</div>

<p>Her morning was spent in vague attempts
to do something, and it was with satisfaction
that she beheld her two nephews approaching
by a road which led through woods and
fields. The borrowed pail was not visible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
but Mrs. Burton did not notice its absence.
Toddie dropped dejectedly upon a large
stone in the back yard, and Budge sauntered
into the sitting-room with the air of a man of
the world who had squeezed life’s orange and
found it juiceless.</p>

<p>“You’re safely back, are you?” asked Mrs.
Burton, anxious to know what had happened,
but fearing to ask.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we’re back, but that don’t do us
any good.”</p>

<p>“Why, what can be the matter with my
dear little Budge?”</p>

<p>“A good deal,” sighed Budge. “There’
some awful funny things in this world, Aunt
Alice, an’ they ain’t nice either.”</p>

<p>“Tell me all about them, dear.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was awful disappointed to-day.
We found sixteen eggs in a nest, an’ I came
all the way home to get somethin’ to cook ’em
in, an’ I carried some salt an’ pepper with
me to help ’em to taste nice, an’ when we
cooked ’em, what do you think? There was
a little chicken inside of each of ’em!”</p>

<p>“Dis&mdash;gusting!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“I know it is,” said Budge; “an’ I guess
you’d have thought so more yet if you’d been
there when we opened ’em. You know how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
nice eggs smell when you open ’em? Well,
those eggs didn’t even smell good a bit.”</p>

<p>“Let’s talk of something else, Budge,” said
Mrs. Burton, instinctively raising her handkerchief
to her nose.</p>

<p>“But I ain’t through yet,” said Budge. “I
want to know why the little chickens didn’t
come out of their shell to their mamma, instead
of waiting to bother us?”</p>

<p>“Because you scared their mamma away
from them, I suppose, when you found the
nest.”</p>

<p>“Why, no, we didn’t. She just went away.
We said ‘Chick, chick, chick!’s to her, an’ she
just ran around an’ cackled, so we s’posed
she’d got through with the nest, and we took
what was in it to keep ’em from bein’ spoiled.
Papa says eggs always spoil when they lie out
in the sunshine. What do you s’pose that
poor hen mamma’ll think when she comes
walkin’ along that way some day an’ sees
all her dear little children lyin’ around
mussed up in the grass?”</p>

<p>“She will probably think that some meddlesome
little boys have been along that way,
and haven’t cared for anything or anybody
but themselves.”</p>

<p>Budge looked up quickly into his aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>’
face, but finding neither humor nor sympathy
there he sighed deeply and started to
rejoin his brother.</p>

<p>“Budge!” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>The child arrested his steps, and looked
back inquiringly.</p>

<p>“When you want anything, as, for instance,
that pail to boil eggs in, the proper way to do
is to ask for it honestly and if some grown
person refuses to give it to you, you should be
satisfied with the reasons they give and make
no trouble about it. You ought to love
what is right so much that you will be
ashamed to get around it in some underhand
way.”</p>

<p>“Why, ’tain’t any underhand way to say
just what I think, is it?” Budge asked. “Papa
says folks ought always to be honest, and say
just exactly what they mean, an’ I’m sure I
always do it, but I like to say things the way
that I think folks listen to ’em best. Ain’t
that the way that you do?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton could not say “No,” and
would not say “Yes,” so she walked off and
left her nephew master of the field, from
which he himself soon retired in response to
repeated shouts of “Budgie!” from his
brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Budgie,” exclaimed Toddie, as the
former rejoined him,” izhe got him! Oh,
izhe got him! Ain’t you glad?”</p>

<p>“Who you got?”</p>

<p>“Got Terry!” exclaimed Toddie. “Got
doggie Terry!”</p>

<p>“Ow!” shouted Budge, clapping his hands
and dancing about. “That’s the nicest thing
I ever heard of! Just won’t we have fun?
How did you catch him?”</p>

<p>“Why, he wazh asleep, an’ I dzust tied a
skring to his collar, an’ tied de uvver end to
a little tree, an’ dere he is. See him?”</p>

<p>The brothers moved towards the dog; the
doomed animal, after one frantic tug at his
bonds, recognized the inevitable and shrank
whimperingly against the tree.</p>

<p>“Poor doggie’s sick, Tod,” said Budge.
“We’ll have to play doctor to him an’ make
him well. I think he ought to go to bed,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yesh,” said Toddie, “an’ have a night-gown
on, like we do when we’s sick.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. You run an’ get yours for
him. He needs a little one, you know. I
guess you’d better take off your shoes, so’
not to disturb Aunt Alice.”</p>

<p>Toddie cast his shoes and vanished, re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>turning
speedily with a robe in which the
dog Terry, not without much remonstrance,
was soon enveloped; after which Budge lifted
him tenderly in his arms, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>“His night-gown hangs down an awful lot,
I think. We’d better pin up the bottom
part, like nurse did for the sister-baby the
other day.”</p>

<p>“Hazhn’t got no pins,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll tie it up with a string. Besides,
when it’s tied up he can’t get his foots
out, an’ forget what a poor little sick doggie
he is.”</p>

<p>In another moment the superabundant
skirts were folded up and tied tightly around
the poor animal’s body, while Toddie, who
was having great trouble to hold the stout
little beast, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Gwacious! the fwont end of him is awful
well! See how it keeps not keepin’ still. I
don’t fink his night-gown collar looksh very
nysh, does you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Budge,” and he’ll go right out
of it if we don’t make it look nicer. I’ll put
string around that too&mdash;there! I want to
know if anybody ever saw a lovelier-lookin’
sick dog than that? Where’ll we put him to
bed now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

<p>“Let’s wock him,” Toddie suggested.
“Datsh what we likes when we’s sick.”</p>

<p>“Then we got to take him in the house,”
said Budge, “’cause there ain’t any way of
makin’ believe rockin’-chair. Come on!”</p>

<p>Quietly the couple sneaked into the house
and up to their room. Then Budgie resigned
his precious burden a moment to Toddie’
care while he went in search of a rocking-chair,
with which he shortly returned.</p>

<p>“There!” said he, taking the invalid and
seating himself, “this is something like playin’
doctor. But I wonder what kind of medicine
he ought to have?&mdash;pills or powders?”</p>

<p>“Or running stuff out of a bottle?” suggested
Toddie.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Budge. “I guess it
’pends on what kind of medicine we’ve got.
We might make him some nice pills out of
soap.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Toddie, going into the
closet, bringing from a corner an old winter
cloak trimmed with beads, and picking some
of the beads from it; “these is splendid for
pills. I took some of ’em de uvver day when
I wazsh playin’ doctor an’ sick boy too, an’
dey didn’t taste bad a bit.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Budge, “pick some off.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>”
His order was obeyed, and soon the beads
were being carefully dropped, one by one,
down the dog’s throat, Budge opening the
animal’s mouth with finger and thumb as he
had seen his father do. Soon, however, the
dog’s jaws closed tightly.</p>

<p>“I want to make him well,” said Toddie.
“I ain’t doctored him a bit yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hardly know what you can do for
him,” said Budge, “for he won’t take any
more pills. Perhaps there’s a sore place on
his head somewhere that you might put a
stickin’-plaster on; but you haven’t got any
plaster. Oh, I’ll tell you what; you can get a
postage-stamp out of Uncle Harry’s desk&mdash;that’ll
do for a stickin’-plaster first-rate.”</p>

<p>“I wantsh to wock him,” said Toddie,
“’ides doct’rin’ him.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid ’twon’t be best to move him
just now,” said Budge, scanning the face of
the patient with solicitude.</p>

<p>“I tell you what,” said Toddie, with the
air of a man to whom had come a direct inspiration
“letsh stop makin’ b’lieve for a
minute, till I get hold of him; den he can be
made into a sick boy again.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Budge, though evidently
against his will. “I s’pose I’ve got to, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
that all the doctors get a chance at him. But
say, papa says, mixin’ doctors kills sick folks.
Don’t you think we’d better talk it all
over again? ’Twould be dreadful if Uncle
Harry’s dear little dog was made dead, you
know.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Toddie, “an’ I’ll hold him
while we talk about it. I won’t give him a
single bittie of medshin ’til we know dzust
what he ought to have.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe different people’s arms make a
difference to sick folks,” suggested Budge,
holding the patient still more tenderly, and
oblivious to Toddie’s outstretched arms.</p>

<p>“Dzust see how sad he looks at you!” said
Toddie. “I fink his eyes is a-sayin’, ‘Oh, I’ll
die if dat dear Doctor Toddie don’t nurse me.’
I shouldn’t fink you could be so dreadful
cruel, Budgie.”</p>

<p>Budge reluctantly relinquished the patient,
on whom Toddie bestowed a squeeze
so affectionate that the dog howled piteously,
and struggled to free himself.</p>

<p>“There!” said Budge,” what did I tell you.
You’re the kind of doctor that don’t agree
with him, you see.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t me,” said Toddie. “I guesh it’
de medshin takin’ effec’. Dem beads&mdash;pills,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
I mean&mdash;can’t get into his bonesh an’ mushels
wifout skwatchin’ him.”</p>

<p>“I ’pect that’s ’cause we forgot to give
’em to him in somethin’ nice, like papa gives
us our medicine.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>“Letsh give him
somefin’ nysh
now!” said Toddie,
“Mebbe it can find
de medshin, an’ dey’ll go along nysh togevver,
dzust like two little budders.”</p>

<p>“All right. What’ll it be?”</p>

<p>“Cake.”</p>

<p>“Who’ll ask Aunt Alice for it?” Budge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
asked. “I guess you’d better; I did, last
time we wanted cake. Anyhow, I was getting
it without askin’, an’ I promised her I’d always
ask after that.”</p>

<p>“Den you ought to begin, right stwaight
away,” said Toddie, “elsh mebbe you’d forget.
I know what you wantsh! You wants
me to ask so’s you can get poor sick baby
again while I go.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Budge, somewhat abashed,
“I suppose I’ll have to do it.”</p>

<p>He departed, and returned within two or
three minutes with a large piece of fruit cake
and a radiant countenance.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Tod, just don’t folks get paid
for bein’ good? I was going down to ask
Aunt Alice, just as good as could be, and then
I couldn’t find her anywhere in the house, so
there wasn’t anythin’ to do but go get the
cake myself. I don’t believe we’d have got
such a big piece, either, if she’d been there;
now I know what that big thing on the Sunday-school
wall means, ‘Wirtue is its own
reward.’”</p>

<p>“Gwacious Peter!” exclaimed Toddie, extending
his hand for the cake; “we dassent
give him all dat! ’Twould make him dweam
dweadful fings.” Here Toddie put the cake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
to the dog’s mouth, and the animal eagerly
bit at it. “Goodnish! I forgot dat dogs
could open moufs bigger dan babies. I fink
he’s got more now dan’ going to agree wif
him. G’way!” continued Toddie, as the dog
again snapped at the cake. “We’s got to
put dis where he can’t see it, ’less he’ll be
cryin’ for it all de time.” And Toddie hastily
crowded a large portion of the remainder into
his own mouth.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;h&mdash;h!” exclaimed Budge, moving
to the rescue of the remainder of the cake.
“You ain’t took no medicine, an’ you’ll
dream of more cows than you ever saw.
Give me it!”</p>

<p>“Um&mdash;m&mdash;m&mdash;ugh&mdash;mow&mdash;moo-um&mdash;guh!”
mumbled Toddie with difficulty, as he
tightened his grasp on the remainder of the
cake.</p>

<p>“Oh, give it to me, Tod!” pleaded Budge.
“I’ll eat it, and then I’ll dream ’bout the
same cows that you do. Don’t you know
how often you wish I’d dream the same things
you do, and get mad ’cause I don’t?”</p>

<p>Toddie indulged in some spasmodic final
gulps, coughed violently, and said:</p>

<p>“It’s dwefful to dweam about cows, an’ I
loves you, ’cauzh you’s my dee budder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
Budgie, an’ I don’t want you to dweam dwefful
fings.” Here Toddie hastily crammed
most of the remainder of the cake into his
mouth, and handed the rest to his brother,
saying:</p>

<p>“That’ll make&mdash;you&mdash;dweam ’bout two
or&mdash;or free cows, an’ so it’ll let you get into
de dweam wifout such drefful times as Izh
got to have.”</p>

<p>Budge might, perhaps, have recognized in
fitting terms this evidence of brotherly forethought,
but his mouth found other occupation
for a moment. Meanwhile, the patient
was wriggling; by a desperate effort he freed
himself from Toddie’s embrace, and fell upon
the floor, where he rolled frantically about
with many contortions and howls.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s got a convulsion! I guess he
must be havin’ a stomach tooth come,” said
Budge. “What can we do?”</p>

<p>“Pallygollic,” Toddie suggested.</p>

<p>“We ain’t got none,” said Budge. “Tell
you what. Let’s make b’lieve he’s a dog a
minute, an’ throw water on him. That’
what they do to dogs in fits.”</p>

<p>“Den we’d get Aunt Alice’s new carpet all
wet,” said Toddie. “Let’s put him in de
bafftub.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span></p>

<p>“Just the thing!” said Budge, picking up
the animal while Toddie ran before and
turned on the water. The dog was dropped
into the tub, where he naturally redoubled
his efforts to free himself; noting which,
Budge remarked:</p>

<p>“Say, Tod, it’s hot water they set babies in
when the tooths bother ’em. We’ll make
b’lieve he’s a baby again, and turn on t’other
faucet.”</p>

<p>Toddie quickly opened the hot-water
faucet.</p>

<p>“There&mdash;he’s gettin’ better,” said Budge,
observing the animal with professional closeness.
“I guess he can come out now. OW!&mdash;that
water’s awful hot! How are we goin’
to get him out?”</p>

<p>Toddie leaned over the edge of the tub and
seized the dog by the head. The animal
struggled violently. Toddie redoubled his
exertions, lost his balance, and tumbled
headlong into the tub himself, from which he
speedily scrambled, howling violently, while
Budge snatched the animal and landed him
on the bathroom floor.</p>

<p>“Oh, de&mdash;oh!” cried Toddie.</p>

<p>“Does it hurt you awful, dear little
brother?” asked Budge tenderly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span></p>

<p>“No! De hurtzh gone off of me, but I
gotted a lot of water in my mouf, and it
washed out all de taste of de cake. I fink it’
too good-for-nuffin mean for anyfing.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you’d better go sit out in
the sun and dry yourself,” said Budge, “and
change the poor doggie’s clothes for him.”</p>

<p>“Wantsh my clozhezh tschanged,” sobbed
Toddie.</p>

<p>“Come on, then,” said Budge, leading the
way back to his own room, and dragging the
bundle of wet dog behind him. “There!”
said he, closing the door, “you dress yourself
and I’ll fix the dog.”</p>

<p>Carefully untying the strings that confined
the animal, but taking the precaution to tie
one end to Terry’s collar and the other to a
chair, he removed the night-gown, brought a
brush, comb, and bottle of cologne from his
aunt’s room, and began to brush the dog’
coat, pouring on cologne without stint. The
animal was too grateful to be on his feet again
to offer any serious remonstrance, until suddenly
Budge poured considerable cologne
upon his head; the liquid found its way into
Terry’s eyes, and the spirits put the brute in
such pain that he began to dash frantically
about the room, dragging the light chair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
after him. Budge had left the door open,
and through this dashed Terry, and down the
stairs. The top of the chair struck the stair-rail,
and at once resolved itself into its original
parts; the remainder flew
down the steps after the
dog, and executed a
rapid semicircle in
air in the lower
hall as the dog
flew around
the newel
post and
encountered a handsome cabinet hat-rack on
the way, to the great damage of the polish.</p>

<div class="figright">

<div class="caption">DOWN THE STAIRS, DASHED TERRY</div>
</div>

<p>Then, still obeying the inexorable demands
of the string, whose other end was attached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
to the collar of the dog, it meandered through
the parlor, leaving a leg with the piano pedal
as a memento of a trifling difference, attempted
to ascend the chimney through the
fireplace but succeeded only so far as to seriously
compromise the positions of the andirons,
lodged between the legs of an antique
table to the complete prostration of the table
itself, and leaving the seat of the chair among
the table’s varied contents, struck a jardinière,
which came down with a ceramic crash,
flew to the dining-room, into a chair, upon
and across the table, taking with it a cover
with which for a moment or two it was seriously
mixed, and went down the kitchen
stairs, where it met Mrs. Burton returning
from a conference with the greengrocer. As
the chair was one of special lightness and exceeding
cost, Mrs. Burton was naturally desirous
of interviewing Terry; but the animal
had evidently formed plans which he did not
intend should be thwarted, so with a vicious
snap he eluded her, dashed through the
kitchen and sought the shady solitude of the
forest.</p>

<p>Intuition and experience combined to suggest
to Mrs. Burton the original causes of
Terry’s excitement; so, waiting only a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
moments, that she might be perfectly calm
and righteously judicial, she started in search
of the culprits. They were not in their room,
though a heap of wet clothes and a general
displacement of everything proved that they
had been there since the chambermaid had
put the room in order. A further search disclosed
Toddie upon Mrs. Burton’s own bed,
so soundly asleep that she had not the heart
to wake him. Promptly assuming that
Budge was the only culprit, she continued
her search, and found him leaning out of a
window in a little observatory on the top of
the house. The rustle of his aunt’s dress
aroused him, and, bending upon her a look of
exquisite yet melancholy sensitiveness, he
said:</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice, everybody must die, mustn’t
they?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mrs. Burton, “and if you
had paid the debt of nature before destroying
my pretty chair your earthly influence might
have been less injurious than it has been this
morning.”</p>

<p>“But, Aunt Alice,” said Budge, absorbed
in his own thoughts, “do you see that graveyard
way off yonder? It’s awful full of dead
folks, ain’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>

<p>“Very,” said Mrs. Burton; “but what they
have to do with a ruined chair I am unable
to see.”</p>

<p>“Well, what I want to know,” said Budge,
still oblivious to everything but the matter
that was occupying his mind&mdash;“what I want
to know is, who’s goin’ to throw flowers into
the last man’ grave, an’ who’s goin’ to make
the hole that he’s put into? What if he
should be me? I’d feel awful bothered to
know how I’d have any funeral at all. I
know what I’d do&mdash;I’d just pray the Lord
to take me straight up to heaven, like he did
with the good Elijah. Say, Aunt Alice, what
drawed the chariot that Elijah went up in?
Did them ravens do it that used to bring him
his lunch?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Mrs. Burton, “but no
chariot would ever have come for him if he
had been in the habit of breaking up chairs
and tying pieces of them to dogs.”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Budge, beginning to comprehend
the drift of his aunt’s remarks, “I
didn’t tie any piece of any chair to any dog.
I tied all of Terry to a chair, and was bein’ as
nice to him as you ever was to me, an’ all of a
sudden he ran away with the whole of the
chair. You remember that story in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
Bible about some bad devils goin’ into a lot
of pigs an’ makin’ ’em jump over the side of a
mountain an’ into the ocean? Well, I think
some of them same chaps must have got into
Terry.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p275.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“WHY AUNT ALICE! HOW DID YOU UPSET THAT TABLE?”</div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Burton’s faith in this demonological
theory was not strong,
but she felt that her
wrath had deserted her,
so to escape further
humiliation she descended to the parlor. The
scene which presented itself to her gaze was
one to which womanly language could not do
justice, and her hurried attempts to repair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
the damage were not sufficient to prevent the
reawakening of her anger. While still in the
depths of her indignant despair, her nephew
Budge entered the room and exclaimed
honestly:</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice, how did you upset that table
and break that handsome great big vase of
make-believe flowers?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton instinctively rose to her feet,
assumed a conventional attitude of Lady
Macbeth, and shook a forefinger at Budge in
a menacing manner that caused the child to
shudder, as she uttered the single word&mdash;</p>

<p>“Tomorrow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p>




</div><div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>“The beginning of the end!” was the remark
with which Mr. Burton broke a
short silence at his breakfast-table, on the
last day of the time for which his little visitors
had been invited.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton looked meek and made no
reply.</p>

<p>“Budders,” said Mr. Burton, addressing
his nephews, “do you feel reconstructed?”</p>

<p>“Huh?” asked Budge.</p>

<p>“Do you feel mentally and morally reconstructed?”
repeated the uncle.</p>

<p>“Reconwhichted?” asked Budge.</p>

<p>“That’s an awful big wyde,” remarked
Toddie, through a mouthful of oatmeal porridge.
“It’s like what the minister says in
chych sometimes, an’ makes me want to
play around in the seat.”</p>

<p>“Reconstructed; made over again,” explained
Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“Why, no,” said Budge, after looking at
his hands and feeling for his stomach, as if to
see if any radical physical change had taken
place without his knowledge. “Maybe we’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
a little bigger, but we can’t see ourselves
where we grow.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel as if you wanted to see
that baby sister again?” asked Mrs. Burton,
endeavoring to change the subject. “Don’t
you want to go back to her and stay all the
time?”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” said Toddie, “’cauzh dere ain’t
no dog at our house, an’ tryin’ to catch dogs
is fun, ’cept when dey never want to be
catched at all, like Terry is lotsh of de time.”</p>

<p>“I mean, haven’t you learned, since you’ve
been here, to be a great deal better than you
ever were before?” asked Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“I guesh so,” Toddie replied. “I’zhe said
more prayersh an’ sung more little hymns
dan I ever did in all my life before. An’ I
ain’t pulled off any more hind hoppers from
gwasshoppers sinsh Aunt Alice told me it
wazh bad. I only pulls off front hoppers
now. Dey’zh real little, you know&mdash;dere’
only a little bittie of ’em to feel hurted.”</p>

<p>“How is it with you, Budge?” asked Mr.
Burton. “Do you feel as if you had learned
to act from different motives.”</p>

<p>“What’s a motive?” asked Budge; “anythin’
like a loco-motive? I never feel like
them, ’xcept when I run pretty hard; then I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
puff like everythin’, only steam don’t come
out of me, but I always think there’s an engine
inside of me, goin’ punk! punk! like
everything. Papa says it’s only a heart&mdash;a
little bit of a boy’s heart, but if that’s all, I
should think a big man’ heart could pull a
whole train of cars.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t learned to bear in mind the
subject of conversation. But have you become
able to comprehend the inner significance
of things?”</p>

<p>“Things inside of us, do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Like oatmeal powwidge?” Toddie suggested.</p>

<p>“Have you realized that a master mind
has been exerting a reformatory influence
upon you?”</p>

<p>“Izh master mind an’ ’must mind’s de
same fing?” asked Toddie. “We wasn’t
doin’ noffin’ ’cept eatin’ our brekspups.
Don’t see what we’s got to mind about.”</p>

<p>“Have you always unhesitatingly obeyed
your aunt’s commands, moved thereunto by
a sense of her superiority by divine right?”</p>

<p>“Now, Harry!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton,
who during this conversation had been making
mute appeals which her husband could
not have resisted had he seen them, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
knowing of the existence of which he had
carefully kept his eyes averted from her
face.</p>

<p>“If you don’t stop tormenting those poor
children with stupid sections of dictionary
you yourself shall realize my superiority by
divine right, for I’ll take them up-stairs and
away from you.”</p>

<p>“Only one more question, my dear,” said
Mr. Burton, “and I’ll have done. I want
only to ask the boys if they’ve noticed any
conflicts of heredity, and, if so, which side
has triumphed?”</p>

<p>“I guess you are tryin’ to play preacher,
like Tod said,” remarked Budge.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Mr. Burton, blushing a little
under a merry laugh from his wife. “Well,
how does it affect you?”</p>

<p>“It makes me feel like I do in church when
I wish Sunday-school time would hurry up,”
said Budge.</p>

<p>“Me too,” assented Toddie.</p>

<p>“You can run away and play now,” said
Mrs. Burton, seeing that the children’s plates
were empty.</p>

<p>The boys departed, the dog Terry apparently
leading the way, yet being invisible
when the children reached the open air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p>“You needn’t have humiliated me before
the children,” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>Mr. Burton hastened to make the “amende
honorable” peculiar to the conjugal relation
and said:</p>

<p>“Don’t fear, my dear. They didn’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, didn’t they?” exclaimed Mrs. Burton.
“I wish all my adult friends had as quick
perceptions as those boys. They may not
understand big words, but tones and looks
are enough for them.”</p>

<p>“Why?” said Mr. Burton, “they scarcely
looked up from their plates.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” replied the lady, delighted
at an opportunity to reassert her superiority
in at least one particular. “Children&mdash;boys,
are more like women than like men. Their
unblunted sensibilities are quick; their intuition
is simply angelic. Would that their
other qualities were also so perfect.”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry, my dear,” said Mr. Burton,
temporarily subjugated, “that I said a
word to them, and when you are ready to
kneel upon the stool of repentance I’ll depart
and leave you alone.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have no occasion to go,” said Mrs.
Burton. “I’ve confessed already&mdash;to them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
and a single confession is enough. I rather
like the operation, when, for my reward, I
receive sympathy instead of sarcasm.”</p>

<p>“Again, I ask forgiveness,” said Mr. Burton;
“and having made a fellow-penitent of
myself, can’t I have good in return for my
evil, and know what a fellow-sufferer has
learned from experience?”</p>

<p>“Just this,” said Mrs. Burton; “that nobody
is fit to take the care of children excepting
the children’s own parents.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton dropped his fork and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“My dear, that’s better than an experience.
It’s a revelation.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton regained her pleasantness of
countenance and said:</p>

<p>“I think that only one of kindred blood
can comprehend an adult&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Unless modest enough to go out of self
for a little while,” suggested Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton opened her eyes very wide and
dropped her lip a little, but recovered herself
to finish her sentence by “And I think it is
ever so much harder to comprehend children,
with their imperfect natures that never develop
harmoniously, and that can but seldom
express themselves intelligently.”</p>

<p>“I never noticed that the boys were at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
loss to express themselves, when they wanted
anything,” said Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“That sounds just like a man,” said Mrs.
Burton, fully herself again. “As if children
had no desires and yearnings excepting for
material things! What do you suppose it
means when Budge sits down in a corner, goes
into a brown study, and, when asked what the
matter is, drawls ‘Nothin’!’s in a tone that
indicates that a very considerable something
is puzzling his young head? What does it
mean when Toddie asks his half-funny, half-pathetic
questions about matters too great
for his comprehension, and looks as wistful
as ever after he is answered? Do you suppose
they care for nothing but food and
play?”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton felt humbled, and his looks
evinced the nature of his feeling.</p>

<p>“You are right, little woman. I wish I
might have consulted you before I took the
boys in hand last summer.”</p>

<p>“And I’m very glad you didn’t,” said Mrs.
Burton; “for you did a great deal better
with them than you could have done if I had
been your adviser. There is some of the
same blood in both of you, and you succeeded
in many points where I have blundered. Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
if I had but known it all before they came!
How much I might have spared them&mdash;and
myself!”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton hastened to extend to his wife
some mute sympathy.</p>

<p>“They’re going to-day,” said Mrs. Burton,
finding something in her eyes that required
the attention of her kerchief&mdash;“just as I’ve
learned what I should be to them! They’re
angels, in spite of their pranks, and it’s always
so with angels’s visits; one never discovers
what they are until they spread their
wings to depart.”</p>

<p>“This particular pair of angels can be borrowed
for an extra day, I suppose, if you desire
it!” suggested Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“I declare,” said Mrs. Burton, “that’s a
brilliant idea! I’ll go tell Helen that I don’t
think she’s yet fit to have them back
again.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said Mr. Burton, preparing to go
to the city, “will try to persuade Tom into
the same belief, though I know he’ll look like
a man being led to execution.”</p>

<p>The Burtons left the house together a few
minutes later, and the boys returned soon
after. Being unable to find their aunt, they
descended to the kitchen, and made a formal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
demand upon the cook for saucers, spoons,
sugar and cream.</p>

<p>“An’ fhot are yees up to now?” asked
Bridget.</p>

<p>“You’ll see, after you give us the things,”
said Budge.</p>

<p>“Deysh the reddesht, biggesht ones I ever
saw anywheresh,” Toddie exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I don’t want ye to be takin’ the things
way off to nobody but the dhivil knows
where,” said Bridget. “Fhot if yees should
lose one of the shpoons an’ the misthress ’ud
think I sthole it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we won’t go anywheres but ’cept
under the trees in the back yard,” pleaded
Budge. “An’ there’s all the nice berries
spoilin’ now while you’re botherin’ about it.
My papa says berries ought always to be
eaten just when they’re picked.”</p>

<p>“Av it’s only berries, I s’pose yees can
have the things,” muttered Bridget, bringing
from a closet a small tray, and covering it
with the desired articles.</p>

<p>“Give us another saucer, an’ we’ll bring
you some,” said Budge, “’cause you’re nice
to us. We’ll need more sugar, though, if
we’re goin’ to do that.”</p>

<p>In the presence of flattery Bridget showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
herself only a woman. She replaced the teacup
of sugar with a well-filled bowl; she even
put a few lumps on top of the powdered article
which filled the bowl, and as the boys
departed she remarked to the chambermaid
that “that bye Budge is a rale gintleman.
I’ve heard as how his father’s folks came
from the ould counthry, an’ mark me words,
Jane, they’re from the nobility.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mrs. Burton emerged
from the sick-room of her sister-in-law. She
had meant to stay but a moment, but Mrs.
Lawrence’s miniature had, as a special favor,
been placed in Mrs. Burton’s arms, and it was
so wee and helpless, and made such funny
little noises, and blinked so inquiringly, and
stretched forth such a diminutive rose petal
of a hand, that time had flown in apprehension,
and sent the nurse to recapture the
baby and banish the visitor. And Mrs.
Burton was sauntering leisurely homeward,
looking at nothing in particular, touching
tenderly with the tip of her parasol the daisies
and buttercups that looked up to her from
the roadside, stopping even to look inquiringly
upon a solitary ewe, who seemed solicitous
for the welfare of a lamb which playfully
evaded her. Suddenly Mrs. Burton heard a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
howl, a roar, and a scream inextricably
mixed. She immediately dropped all thought
of smaller beings, for she recognized the
tones of her nephews. A moment later, the
noise increasing in volume all the while, both
boys emerged from behind a point of woods,
running rapidly, and alternately howling and
clapping their hands to their mouths. Mrs.
Burton ran to meet them, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Boys, do stop that dreadful noise. What
is the matter?”</p>

<p>“Ow&mdash;um&mdash;oh!” screamed Budge.</p>

<p>“Wezh been&mdash;ow!&mdash;eatin’ some&mdash;some&mdash;ow!&mdash;some
pieces of de bad playsh,” said
Toddie, “wif, oh, oh!&mdash;cream an’ sugar on
’em. But dey wazh dzust as hot as if noffin’
was on ’em.”</p>

<p>“Come back and let aunty see about it,”
said the mystified woman, but Budge howled
and twitched away, while Toddie said:</p>

<p>“Wantzh papa an’ manma! Deyzh had
all little boy bovvers an’ knowsh what to do.
Wantsh to get in our ice-housh an’ never go&mdash;ow!&mdash;out
of it.”</p>

<p>The screaming of the children had been
heard farther than Mrs. Burton imagined it
could be, for a sound of heavy and rapid footsteps
increased behind her and, turning, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
beheld the faithful Mike, Mr. Lawrence’
gardener-coachman.</p>

<p>“Fhot is it, dharlin’?” asked Mike, looking
sharply at each boy, and picking a red speck
from the front of Toddie’s dress. “Murther
alive! red peppers!”</p>

<p>Mike dashed across the street, vaulted a
fence, and into an inclosed bit of woodland,
ran frantically about among the trees, stopped
in front of one and attacked it with his knife,
to the astonishment of Mrs. Burton, who
imagined the man had lost his senses. A few
seconds later he returned with a strip of
bark, which he cut into small pieces as he
ran.</p>

<p>“Here, ye dharlin’ little divils,” said he,
cramming a piece of the bark into each boy’
mouth, “chew that. It’s slippery elm; it’ll
sthop the burnin’. Don’t the byes play that
trick on the other byes at school often an’
often, an’ hasn’t me sister’s childher been
nearly murthered by it? An’ fhot ought
your father do to yees for throyin’ to shwally
such thrash? Oh, but wouldn’t I loike to
foind the dhivils that put yees up to it! Who
was they? Tell me, so I can sind them afther
their father, where it’s hotter than pepper.”</p>

<p>“How did you come to eat red peppers?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
asked Mrs. Burton, as the children escaped
slowly from their pain.</p>

<p>“Why, a boy once told us they was strawberries,”
cried Budge, “an’ to-day we saw a
lot where men was spoilin’ a garden to build
a house, an’ we asked ’em if we could have
’em, an’ they said yes, an’ we brought ’em
all back in a piece of paper, an’ didn’t bite
one of ’em, ’cause we wanted to eat ’em all in
a littel tea-party like gentlemen, and the first
one I chewed&mdash;ow! That poor rich man in
the fire&mdash;I know just how he felt when he
begged Abraham to have his tongue cooled
with a drop of water.”</p>

<p>“Poor old rich man didn’t have all de fire
in hizh mouf, ’pectin’ dat ’twazh goin’ to be
strawbewwies,” sobbed Toddie.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t no dear old Mike to go an’
get him slippery elm, either,” said Budge.
“Soon’s we come back home to stay, Mike,
I’m goin’ to put dirt in the stable-pump, just
to be real good about stoppin’ when you tell
me to.”</p>

<p>“An’ I,” said Toddie, “’zh goin’ to make
you a present all alone by myseff. I don’t
know yet what it’ll be. I guess it’ll have to
be a ’prise. What would you like best?&mdash;a
gold watch or a piece of peanut candy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span></p>

<p>Between two presents of such nearly equal
value Michael, the benefactor, found some
difficulty in deciding, and he walked away
with that application of fingers to head which
is peculiar to many persons when in a quandary.
Meanwhile Mrs. Burton led the children
toward her own house, saying:</p>

<p>“What can we do to-day that can be extremely
nice, little boys? Mamma expects
you home to-morrow, and Aunt Alice wants
to make your last day a very happy one.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow!” exclaimed Budge, apparently
oblivious to all else his aunt had said.
“I thought we were going home to-day!”</p>

<p>“So you were, dear,” said Mrs. Burton;
“but you didn’t seem to be in any hurry, and
I couldn’t bear to let you go so soon. Did
you really want to go to-day?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve been thinkin’ about it an’
countin’ days till to-day ever since we’ve
come,” said Budge. “Sometimes it seemed
as if I’d burst if I couldn’t be back home
again, but I tried to be real good about it,
’cause papa said ’twould be better for the
sister-baby and mamma if we stayed away.
Sometimes in the night-time, I’ve cried because
I wasn’t in my own little bed.”</p>

<p>“You poor dear boy,” said Mrs. Burton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
stopping to kiss Budge, “why didn’t you tell
Aunt Alice when you were so unhappy?”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t do me any good,” said
Budge. “Nobody could but my papa or
mamma. An’ then I don’t like to tell what’
hurtin’ my heart&mdash;somethin’ in my throat
makes me hate to tell such things.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you had a pleasant time at our
house? When you’ve not been doing whatever
you liked, haven’t Uncle Harry and I
been trying to make you happy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. But some folks know just
what we like, and some other folks know
what they want us to like; and the first some
folks are my papa and mamma, an’ the other
some folks are you an’ Uncle Harry. You’ve
done some real nice things for us, though, an’
I’m goin’ to ask mamma to let us invite you
to our house, an’ then I’ll show you how to
take care of little boys an’ make ’em happy!”</p>

<p>“You come to vizhit at our housh,” said
Toddie,” an you can have cake between
mealsh, an’ make mud-pies whenever you
want to, no matter if youzh got your very
besht clozhezh on. An’ I won’t ever say
‘Don’t!’s to you one single time!”</p>

<p>“An’ you shall have your own mamma
come every day to frolic an’ cut up with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
you,” said Budge. “I wish you had a papa;
we’d have him too!”</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice,” said Budge, “how do big
folks get along without papas and mammas?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure, dear,” said Mrs.
Burton, remembering how helpless she found
herself when her husband first took her from
beneath her mother’s wing.</p>

<p>“Don’t they ever have somethin’ to tell
’em, an’ then feel like somebody else when
they find they ain’t there to tell ’em to?”</p>

<p>“I suppose some do,” said Mrs. Burton, recalling
some periods of her own life when she
longed for a confidant who should be neither
lover nor friend.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think maybe they look all
around then, an’ think the nicer things are
the lonelier they are?” continued Budge.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” replied Mrs. Burton, with a
kiss.</p>

<p>“Musht be awful not to have anybody to
ask for pennies when youzh lonesome an’
don’t know what else to do,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“An’ not to have anybody hold you to
keep from kind o’s tumblin’ to pieces when
you’ve seen enough of everythin’, an’ done
enough of everythin’, an’ don’t know what’
goin’ to happen next, an’ wish it wouldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
happen at all,” said Budge. “Say, Aunt
Alice, folks don’t ever have to feel that way
when they get to be angels, do they?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Well, do you think it makes folks in
heaven happy to have a father&mdash;the Lord,
you know, when there ain’t anythin’ to ask
Him for? If they’re happy the whole time, I
don’t see when they can think about how nice
it is to have a heavenly papa. Do little
angels ever have to go away from home an’
stay a few days, an’ not see their father at
all?”</p>

<p>“Mercy&mdash;no!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton,
with a shudder. “Where do you get such
ideas, Budge?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere. I don’t get ’em at all&mdash;they
get me, an’ don’t let go of me until I think
myself most to pieces, or else get somethin’
new to do that makes me forget ’em.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton mentally resolved to immediately
find something new for Budge to do,
if only to keep him from leading her mind
upon ground which, being unknown to her,
she assumed must be dangerous. Her anxiety
was not lessened when Toddie strayed
into more active conversation.</p>

<p>“Aunt Alish,” said he, “what does little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
boy angels do wif deir pennies when dey get
’em? Ish dere candy stores up in hebben,
and do de folks dat keeps ’em give more for a
penny dan dey do here?”</p>

<p>“Pennies are of no use in heaven, Toddie,”
said Mrs. Burton, almost frantic to find a
way of escape from the pair of literalists, yet
remembering her longings of the early morning,
to have the boys with her that she might
find her way to their hearts and lead them
into her own.</p>

<p>“What? Not good for anyfin’?” asked
Toddie. “Wouldn’t it be dweadful den if I
was to get to be an angel right now?&mdash;dere’h
sixty-four pennies in my savings bank.”</p>

<p>“You can’t carry pennies to heaven, you
silly boy!” exclaimed Budge. “In a place
where the streets are made of gold, you don’t
s’pose anybody cares for pennies, do you? I
don’t b’lieve you could buy a single stick of
candy there for less than a dollar bill!”</p>

<p>“If you little boys are so fond of candy,”
said Mrs. Burton, in desperation, “we will
make a lot ourselves, after lunch.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” Budge exclaimed. “Can common
folks like us make candy?”</p>

<p>“But we are not common folks, Budge.”</p>

<p>“I think we are,” said the boy, “when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
think what lovely people candy-makers
must be.”</p>

<p>“How much will we make?” asked Toddie.
“Two pennies’s worth?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. More than two little boys can
eat in a day.”</p>

<p>“Gwacious Peter!” Toddie exclaimed,
“dat would be more dan a whole candystore
full! Come
on! Don’t letsh eat
any lunch at all,
so’s to have our
tummuks all empty
for de candy.”</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/p295.jpg" alt="Fairies making candy" />
</div>

<p>“I’ll bet I
can walk faster
than you
can, Aunt
Alice,” said
Budge, tugging
at his aunt with one hand and pushing
her with the other.</p>

<p>“I can run faster dan bofe of you,”
shouted Toddie. “Come on!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton declined both challenges, so
the boys went rapidly over the course without
her and ran frantically up and down the
piazza until their aunt joined them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span></p>

<p>“What are you goin’ to make it in, Aunt
Alice?” shouted Budge, while Mrs. Burton
was yet a hundred yards away.</p>

<p>“A saucepan.”</p>

<p>“A washboiler would be better&mdash;two washboilersh!”
suggested Toddie.</p>

<p>“Now, do you want to go home to-day,
Budge?” asked Mrs. Burton mischievously.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;well&mdash;I guess you’d better not remind
me very much about it,” replied Budge,
“else maybe I will. What kind of candy is
it goin’ to be?”</p>

<p>“Molasses.”</p>

<p>“De stick kind, or de sticky?” asked
Toddie.</p>

<p>“Both,” replied the lady, ascending the
steps.</p>

<p>“Oh, goody, goody!” exclaimed Toddie,
clutching at his aunt’s dress. “I wants to
kish you.”</p>

<p>“An’ I want to give you an awful big
hug,” said Budge.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton accepted these proffered
tokens of esteem and afterward spent two
miserable hours in trying to pacify the boys
until lunch-time. They ate scarcely anything,
and remonstrated so persistently
against their aunt’s appetite that the meal
remained almost untouched. Then the lady
was escorted to the kitchen by her nephews
and there was an animated discussion as to
the size of the saucepan to be used, and the
boys watched the pouring of the molasses so
closely that not a fly dared to assist. Then
they quarreled for the right to stir the odorous
mass until Mrs. Burton was obliged to
allot them three-minute reliefs by the kitchen
clock, and Budge declared that his turns
didn’t last more than a second, while Toddie
complained that they occupied two hours,
and each boy had to assist at the critical
operation of “trying,” and they consumed
what seemed to them long, weary years in
watching the paste cool itself. When, at
last, Mrs. Burton pronounced one panfull
ready to “pull,” a deep sigh of relief burst
from each little chest.</p>

<p>“This is the way to pull candy,” said Mrs.
Burton, touching her fingers lightly with
butter, and then taking a portion of the paste
from a pan and drawing it into a string in the
usual manner. “And here,” she said, separating
the smaller portions, “is a piece for
each of you.”</p>

<p>Budge carefully oiled his fingers as he had
seen his aunt do, and proceeded cautiously to
draw his candy, but Toddie seized his portion
with both hands, raised it to his mouth,
and fastened his teeth in it. Mrs. Burton
sprang at him in an instant.</p>

<p>“Stop, Toddie&mdash;quick! It may fasten your
teeth together so you can’t easily open them.”</p>

<p>Many were the inarticulate noises, all in a
tone of remonstrance, that Toddie made as
his aunt forcibly removed the mass from his
face. When at last he could open his mouth
he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Don’t want mine pulled! itsh too awful
good the way it izh&mdash;you’ll pull de good out,
I’zh ’fwaid.”</p>

<p>“You boys should have aprons,” said Mrs.
Burton. “Budge, put down your candy,
run up-stairs and tell Jane to bring down two
of Toddie’s aprons.”</p>

<p>Budge hurried up-stairs, forgetting the
first half of his aunt’s injunction. Returning,
he had just reached the foot of the main
stair, when the door-bell rang. Hastily putting
his candy down, he opened the door and
admitted two ladies, who asked for Mrs.
Burton.</p>

<p>“I guess she’s too busy makin’ candy to be
bothered by any lady,” said Budge, “but I’ll
ask her. Sit down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span></p>

<p>Ten minutes later, Mrs. Burton, by a concentration
of effort peculiar to woman, but
which must ever remain a mystery to man,
entered the parlor in afternoon dress, and
greeted her visitors. Both rose to meet her,
and with one of them rose also a rocking-chair
with a cane seat. This remained in
mid-air only an instant, however, for the
lady’s dress had not been designed for the
purpose of moving furniture; with a sharp,
ripping sound, like that of musketry file-firing
afar off, her skirt soon took the appearance
of a train dress, heavily puffed at the
waist with fabric of another color.</p>

<p>Both ladies endeavored to disengage her;
Mrs. Burton turned pale and then red as she
discovered the cause of the accident, while
Budge’s voice was heard from the doorway
saying:</p>

<p>“Aunt Alice, have you seen my candy? I
laid it down somewhere so’s to let the ladies
in, an’ now I can’t find it!”</p>

<p>An indignant gesture by Mrs. Burton sent
Budge away pouting and grumbling and the
chambermaid was summoned, the visitor’
dress was repaired temporarily and the accident
was being laughed away, when from the
kitchen there arose an appalling sound. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
was compounded of shrieks, yelps, and a peculiar
noise as of something being thrown
upon the floor.</p>

<p>The noise increased; there were irregular
footfalls upon the kitchen-stairs, and at last
Toddie appeared, dragging by the collar the
dog Terry, from whose fore feet hung, by a
slowly lengthening rope of candy, one of the
pans of the unpulled paste.</p>

<p>“I fought if I gived him candy he would
be nicer to me,” Toddie explained,” so I
chased him into a closet, an’ put the pan
up to his nose, an’ told him to help hisself.
And he stuck his foot in, an’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Further explanation was given by deeds,
not words, for as Toddie spoke the dog kicked
violently with his hind feet, disengaged himself
from Toddie and started for the door,
dragging and lengthening his sweet bonds
behind him upon the floor. Toddie shrieked
and attempted to catch him, stepped upon
the candy-rope, found himself fastened to
the carpet, and burst into tears, while the
visitors departed and told stories which by
the next afternoon had developed into the
statement that Mrs. Burton had been foolish
enough to indulge her nephews in a candy-pulling
in her parlor and upon her new carpet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

<p>As for the boys, Budge ate some of his
candy, and Toddie ate much of everybodies,
and had difficulty in saving a fragment for
his uncle. And when at night he knelt in
spotless white to pray he informed Heaven
that now he understood what ladies meant
when they said they had had a real sweet
time.</p>

<p>Sang Budge through the hall next morning,
and he repeated the lines over and
over so many times that they at last impressed
themselves upon the mind of Toddie, who
asked:</p>

<p>“Budgie, izh you a-tellin’ de troof?”</p>

<p>“What ’bout?”</p>

<p>“Why, ’bout not dyin’. Don’t little boys
hazh to die after goin’ to live wif their uncles
an’ aunts for a little while?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course they do, but I’m so happy
I’ve got to sing somethin’; the front part of it
is troof, and that’s three times as big as the
other part, and I can’t think of any other
song ’bout goin’ home.”</p>

<p>“Datsh too baddy,” complained Toddie.
“I fought you wazh tellin’ the troof, an’ I
wouldn’t never hazh to hazh a lot of dirt on
my eyes, so I couldn’t look up into de sky.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you won’t have to be bothered that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
way,” said Budge. “When you die your
spirit goes up to heaven, an’ you can look
straight down froo the sky with your new
eyes, an’ laugh at the old dirt that thinks it’
keepin’ your old eyes shut up.”</p>

<p>“Don’t want no new eyes! Eyes I’zh
got izh good enough
to see fings wif.”</p>

<p>“But just you
think, Toddie,”
reasoned Budge,
“heaven-eyes can’t
get dust in ’em, or
have to be washed,
or be bothered with
choo-choo smoke.”</p>

<p>“Can’t smoke get
in the windows of
steam-cars up in
hebben?”</p>

<p>“Of course not!
Not if everythin’
goin’ to be all right
up there. There ain’t no choo-choos in
heaven anyhow. What does angels want
of choo-choos, I’d like to know, when they’ve
got wings to fly with?”</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/p303.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“WE’RE GOIN’s HOME”</div>
</div>

<p>“I’d never want all the choo-choos to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
away, even if I had a fousand wingsh,” said
Toddie. “’Twould be such fun to fan myself
wif my wings when I was goin’ froo hot
old tunnels.”</p>

<p>“Tunnels can’t be hot in heaven,” explained
Budge; “’cause they’re uncomfortable,
an’ nothin’ can be uncomfortable in
heaven. I guess there ain’t any tunnels
there at all. Oh, yes! I guess there’s little
bits of ones, just long enough to give little
boys the fun of ridin’ in and ridin’ out of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Well, how’s you goin’ to ride in an’ out if
dere ain’t no choo-choos to pull de cars?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you, Tod, I guess that’s one
of the things that the Bible don’t tell folks
about heaven. You know papa says that
there’s lots of things the Lord don’t let
people know ’bout heaven; ’cause it’
none of their business, an’ I guess that’s one
of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Wish dere’d be some more Bibles, den!
I wantsh to know lotsh more fingsh.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow,” said Budge, “we’re goin’
home to-day, an’ that fills me so full I ain’t
got room for the littlest speck of heaven.
Wonder who’s goin’ to take us, an’ when
we’re a-goin’, an’ ev’rything? Let’s go ask
Uncle Harry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span></p>

<p>“Come on!” exclaimed Toddie, “Izh been
finkin’ awful hard ’bout how to get into his
bedroom wifout bein’ scolded, an’ now I
know. Hurry up ’fore we forgets.”</p>

<p>Both boys hurried to the family chamber,
and assaulted the door with fists and feet.</p>

<p>“’The overture of the angels,’” quoted
Mr. Burton, “’and positively their last appearance.’”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of it,” said Mrs. Burton. “I’ve
been crying about it in my dreams, I believe,
and I’m in a condition to begin again.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a great mind to make them cry,”
said the man of the house savagely. “No
scrubbing will take the mark of small shoe-toes
out of painted wood.”</p>

<p>“Let them kick to their dear little hearts’
content! Not a mark of that kind shall ever
be insulted by a scrubbing brush. I feel as
if I’d like to go about the house and kiss
everything they’ve touched.”</p>

<p>“You might kiss the sounding board of
my violin, then,” said Mr. Burton, “where
there’s an ineffaceable scratch from a nail
in Toddie’s shoe, placed there on the morning
of your birthday anniversary. There’s a nice
generous blot on the wood of the writing-desk,
too, where Toddie upset a bottle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
violet ink. Would that your kisses could
efface the stain that the cabinet-maker says
is indelible. Then there are some dingy
streaks on the wall beside their bed, where
they’ve lain crosswise and rubbed their heads
against the wall.”</p>

<p>“It shall remain forever,” said the lady.</p>

<p>“What! in your darling spare chamber?”</p>

<p>A violent mental struggle showed its indications
in Mrs. Burton’s face, but she replied:</p>

<p>“The furniture can be changed. We can
put a screen in front of the place; we’ll change
the room in any way, excepting their blessed
tokens of occupation.”</p>

<p>But none of this devotion found its way
through the keyhole to shame the boys into
silence, for the noise increased until Mrs.
Burton herself hastened to draw the bolt.</p>

<p>“It’s us,” was the unnecessary information,
volunteered by Budge as the door
opened; “an’ we want to know when we’re
goin’ home, an’ who’s goin’ to take us, an’
how, an’ what you’re goin’ to give us to remember
you by, an’ we don’t care to have it
flowers, ’cause we’ve got plenty of ’em at
home.”</p>

<p>“Fruit-cake would be nicesht,” suggested
Toddie. “Folks ’members that an awful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
long time, ’cause when mamma once asked
papa if he ’membered de fruit-cake at Mrs.
Birch’s party he looked drefful sad, an’ said
he couldn’t ever forget it. Say, Aunt Alish,
don’t you get extra nice dinners for folks
dat’s goin’ away? Mamma always doesh;
says dey need it, cauzh folks need to be well-feeded
when they’e goin’ to travel.” [The
distance from the Burton residence to that
of the Lawrences was about a quarter of a
mile.]</p>

<p>“You shall have a good-by dinner, Toddie,
dear,” said Mrs. Burton; “and the very
nicest one that I can prepare.”</p>

<p>“Better make it a brekspup,” suggested
Toddie. “Mebbe we’ll be come for ’fore
dinner-time.”</p>

<p>“You sha’n’t be taken until you get it,
dear.”</p>

<p>“I ’pects I’ll have an awful good dinner
waitin’ for us, too, when we get home,” said
Budge; “’cause that’s the way the papa in
the Bible did, an’ yet he had only one boy
come home instead of two, an’ he’d been
bad.”</p>

<p>“What portion of the Scriptural narrative
is that child running into now?” asked Mrs.
Burton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>

<p>“Aunt Alice don’t know who you’re talking
about, Budge,” said Mr. Burton. “Explain
it to her.”</p>

<p>“Why, that boy that his papa made a dinner
out of fat veal for,” said Budge; “though
I never could see how that was a very nice
dinner.”</p>

<p>“Worse and worse,” sighed Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Tell us all about it, old fellow,” said Mr.
Burton. “We don’t know what you’re driving
at.”</p>

<p>“Why,” exclaimed Budge, “are you bad
folks that don’t read your Bible-books? I
thought everybody knew about him. Why,
he was a boy that went to his papa one day
and told him that whatever he was goin’ to
give him as long as he lived, he wished he’d
give it to him all at once. An’ his papa did.
Wasn’t he a lovely papa, though? So the
boy took the money, an’ went travelin’, an’
had larks. There’s a picture about it all
in Tommy Bryan’ mamma’s parlor, but
I don’t think it’s very larkey; he’s just
a-sittin’ down with a whole lot of women
actin’ like geese all around him. But he
had to pay money to have larks, an’ he
had such lots of ’em that pretty soon he
didn’t have no money. Say, Uncle Harry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
why don’t people have all the money they
want?”</p>

<p>“That’s the world’s prize conundrum,”
said Mr. Burton. “Ask me something easier.”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to have all the money I wantsh
when I gets growed,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“How are you going to get it?” asked his
uncle, with natural interest.</p>

<p>“Goin’ to be real good, an’ then ashk de
Lord for it,” said Toddie. “Wonder where
de Lord keepsh de lotsh of nysh fings he’
goin’ to give good people when dey ashk Him
for ’em?&mdash;money and fings?”</p>

<p>“Why, in heaven, of course,” said Budge.</p>

<p>“Hazh He got a savin’ bank an’ a toy-store?”
asked Toddie.</p>

<p>“Sh&mdash;h&mdash;h!” whispered Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“He’s only talking of what grown people
expect, my dear,” said Mr. Burton. “Go
on, Budge.”</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t have any more money,
an’ he couldn’t write to his papa for some,
’cause there wasn’t any post offices in that
country, so he went to work for a man, an’
the man made him feed pigs, and he had to
eat the same things that the pigs ate. I
don’t know whether he ate them out of a
troff or not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span></p>

<p>“It’s a great pity that you are in doubt
on that point,” said Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“He could play in de mud like de pigs,
couldn’t he?” said Toddie. “His papa was
too far away to know about it, an’ to say
‘Don’t!’s at him.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose so,” said Budge, “but I don’t
think a boy could feel much like playin’ with
mud when he had to eat with the pigs. Well,
he went along bein’ a pig-feeder, when all at
once he ’membered that there was always
enough to eat at his papa’s house. Say,
Uncle Harry, boys is alike everywhere, ain’t
they?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, present company excepted.
But what reminded you of it?”</p>

<p>“Why, he wanted to go home when he
couldn’t hook enough from the pigs to fill
his stomach, an’ my papa says little boys
that can’t be found when their mamma
wants ’em always start for home when they
get hungry. That’s what this boy off in
another country did&mdash;papa says the Bible
don’t tell whether he told the man to get
another pig-feeder, or whether he just skooted
in a hurry. But, anyhow, he got pretty near
home, an’ I guess he felt awful ashamed of
himself an’ went along the back road; for, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
the picture of our big Bible-book, his clothes
are awful ragged an’ mussy, an’ he must have
been sure he was goin’ to get scolded an’ wish
he could get in the back door an’ go up to his
room without anybody seein’ him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Harry!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton.
“This is growing perfectly dreadful. It’
positively sacrilegious.”</p>

<p>“The application is the only sacred part of
the original, my dear,” said Mr. Burton, “and
you may trust that boy to discover the point
of anything. I wish doctors of divinity were
like him. Go ahead, Budge.”</p>

<p>“Well, he was sneakin’ along, an’ gettin’
behind trees an’ fences whenever he saw anybody
comin’ that he knew, when all at once
his papa saw him. Papas always can see
farther than anybody else, I believe, an’ they
always kind o’s know when their boys are
comin’, an’ they just look as if they’d always
been standin’ right there waitin’ for ’em.
An’ that pig-feeder’s papa ran right out of the
house without his hat on&mdash;that’s the way he
is in the picture in the big Bible-book, an’
grabbed him, an’ kissed him, an’ hugged him
so hard that he had to grunt, an’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“An’ he didn’t say ‘Why, how did you get
your clozhezh so dyty,’s eiver?” said Toddie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<p>“No, indeed! An’ the pig-feeder said he’d
been a bad boy, an’ he guessed he’d better
eat his dinner in the kitchen after that, but
his papa wouldn’t let him. He put clean
clothes on him, an’ gave him a new pair of
shoes, an’ put a ring on his finger.”</p>

<p>“Ringsh ain’t good to eat,” said Toddie.
“I fwallowed one once, I did, an’ it didn’t
taste nohow at all. And den I had to take
some nashty medshin, an’ de ring came unfwallowed
again.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t give him the ring to eat, you
silly boy,” said Budge. “Rings squeeze
fingers all the time, an’ let folks know how
the folks that give ’em the rings want to
squeeze ’em all the time. Then they killed a
whole calf&mdash;’cause the pig-feeder was awful
empty, you know, an’ they had a jolly old
time. An’ the pig-feeder’s big brother heard
’em all cuttin’ up, an’ he was real cross about
it, ’cause he’d always been good, an’ there
hadn’t ever been any tea-parties made for
him. But his papa said, ‘Oh, don’t say a
word&mdash;we’ve got your brother back again&mdash;just
think of that, my boy.’s I’m awful sorry
for that big brother, though; I know how he
felt, for when Tod’s bad, an’ I’m good papa
just takes Tod in his lap an’ talks to him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
an’ hugs him, an’ I feel awful lonesome an’
wish I wasn’t good a bit.”</p>

<p>“And what do you suppose the bad boy’
mamma did when she saw him?” asked Mr.
Burton.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p313.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“SOME NASHTY MEDSHIN”</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh,” said Budge, “I guess she didn’t say
anythin’, but just looked so sad at him that
he made up his mind he wouldn’t ever do a
naughty thing again as long as he lived, an’
after that he’d stand behind her chair whole
half-hours at a time just to look at her where
she wouldn’t catch him at it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span></p>

<p>“And what do you think that whole story
means, Budge?” asked Mrs. Burton, determined
to impress at least one prominent
theological deduction upon her nephew.</p>

<p>“Why, it means that good papas can always
see when bad boys is real ashamed of
themselves,” said Budge, “an’ know it’s best
to be real sweet to ’em then, an’ that papas
that can’t see and don’t know better than
to scold ’em they needn’t ever expect
to see their bad little boys come home
again.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton started, and her husband
laughed inwardly at this unusual application,
but the lady recovered herself and returned
in haste to her point.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it’s intended to teach us
anything about the Lord?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said Budge, “of course. He
is the best of all papas, so he’ll be better to his
bad children than any other good papas
know how to be.”</p>

<p>“That’s what the story is meant to teach,”
said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“I thought everybody knew that about the
Lord.” Budge replied.</p>

<p>“If they did, Jesus would never have told
the story,” said Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I s’pose those old Jews had to be told
it,” said Budge, “’cause folks used to be awful
bad to their children, an’ believe the Lord
would be awful bad to them.”</p>

<p>“People need to be told the same story
now, Budge,” continued Mrs. Burton. “They
love to hear it, and know how good the Lord
is willing to be to them.”</p>

<p>“Do they love it better than to learn how
good they ought to be to their children?”
Budge asked. “Then I think they’re piggish.
I wouldn’t like my papa an’ mamma
to be that way. They say that it’s gooder to
care for what you can give than what you
can get. An’ Uncle Harry hasn’t told us yet
when we’re goin’ home, and who’s goin’ to
take us.”</p>

<p>“Your papa is going to come for you as he
returns from the city,” said Mr. Burton. “I
think he wants to tell you something before
you go home; you little boys don’t know yet
how to act in a house where there’s sick mammas
and little babies.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we do,” said Budge. “All we’ve
got to do is to sit still an’ look at ’em with all
our mights.”</p>

<p>“Only dzust dzump up ev’ry two or free
minutes to kiss ’em,” suggested Toddie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Budge, “an’ to pat their
cheeks an’ to put nice things to eat in their
mouths, like papa an’ mamma does to us,
when we’re sick.”</p>

<p>“An’ make music for ’em,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“An’ give ’em pennies,” said Budge.</p>

<p>“An’ shake their savings banks for ’em to
make de pennies rattle, like Budgie did for
me once when I was too sick to rattle my
own bank,” said Toddie, bestowing a frantic
hug upon his brother.</p>

<p>“An’ put the room to rights for ’em,” said
Budge.</p>

<p>“An’ bring ’em in nice mud-pies all ready
baked, like I did once for Budgie, to play wif
on de bed when he was sick,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“An’ dance for ’em,” suggested Budge.
“That’s the way I used to do for Baby Phillie,
an’ it always made him happy.”</p>

<p>“An’ put up pictures on de wall for ’em,”
said Toddie; “we’s got whole newspapers
full that we’s cutted out up in your garret;
and dere’s a whole bottle of mucilage&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My war file of illustrated papers!” explained
Mr. Burton. “How did they find
that? Oh, this cross of love!”</p>

<p>“Whole bottle of mucilage in papa’s room
to stick ’em on wif,” continued Toddie; “an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>’
mamma’s room is nice pink, like de leaves of
my scrap-book dat pictures look so pretty
on.”</p>

<p>“And these are the child-ideas of being
good and useful!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton, as
the boys forgot everything else in the discovery
of their uncle’s razor-strop with an
extension at one end.</p>

<p>“Yes,” sighed Mr. Burton, “and they’re
not much nearer the proper thing, in spite of
their good intentions, than the plans of grown
people for the management of children, the
reformation of the world, and a great many
other things.”</p>

<p>“Harry!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“No personal allusion, my dear,” said her
husband, quickly. “I’d no thought of anything
of the kind. Adults and children alike
mean well enough; the difference is that the
former wonder why their ideas are not appreciated
while with the children the energies
of parents and teachers are devoted to treating
mistaken opinions as great sins. How
many children could do the kindnesses which
Budge and Toddie have devised out of the
tenderness of their dear little hearts and not
be scolded and whipped for their pains?
Hosts of children have had all the good blood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
and kind heart and honest head scolded and
beaten out of them, and only the baser qualities
of their natures allowed to grow, and
these only because in youth many of them
are dormant and don’t make trouble.”</p>

<p>“Harry, what a preacher you are!&mdash;what a
terrible preacher!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Where does the terror come in?” asked
Mr. Burton, with signs of that indignation
which every man with an idea in advance of
his generation must frequently be afflicted
by.</p>

<p>“Why, to imply that there’s so much injustice
being done to children.”</p>

<p>“Of course the saying of it is worse than
the fact of its existence,” said Mr. Burton,
with a curl of the lip.</p>

<p>“Please don’t speak in that cruel way,
Harry. It isn’t anything of the sort&mdash;excepting
for a moment or two.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burton apologized, and restored confidence
without saying a word, and then the
couple turned instinctively to look at the
first causes of their conversation, but the
boys were gone.</p>

<p>“The tocsin of their souls, the dinner-bell&mdash;breakfast-bell,
I mean, has probably
sounded,” said Mr. Burton; “and I’m as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
hungry as a bear myself. Let’s descend and
see what they’ve succeeded in doing within
five brief minutes.”</p>

<p>The Burtons found the dining-room, but
not the boys and the chambermaid was sent
in search of them. The meal was slowly
consumed but the boys did not appear.</p>

<p>“You’d better have the cook prepare
something additional,” suggested Mr. Burton,
as he arose and started for his train.
“The appetite of the small boy is a principal
that accumulates frightful usury in a very
small while after maturity.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton acted upon her husband’
suggestion, and busied herself about household
affairs for an hour or more, until, learning
that the boys had not yet arrived, she
strolled out to search for them. Supposing
that they might have been overpowered by
their impatience so far as to have gone home
at once, she visited the residence of her sister-in-law,
and inquired of Mike.</p>

<p>“Dhivil a bit have they been here,” replied
Michael. “Ain’t me ould eyes sore for the
soight av ’em all the whoile ag’in? They’re
nowhere about here, rest ye aisy.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid they may be lost,” said Mrs.
Burton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></p>

<p>Mike burst into a prolonged horse laugh,
and then, recovering himself by sundry contortions
and swallowings, he replied:</p>

<p>“Beggin’ yez pardon, ma’am, but I
couldn’t help it&mdash;as the blessed Virgin is
smoilin’ in heaven, I cuddent&mdash;but thim byes
can niver be lost. Lost, is it? Cud ye lose a
ghost or a bird? They’ll foind their way
anywhere they’ve been once, an’ if they
haven’t been there before they’ll belave
they have, an’ foind their way out all roight.
Lave yer boddher till dinner-time, an’ mark
me wurruds ye’ll foind ye’ve no nade av it.
Losht!” and Mike burst into another laugh
that he hurried into the stable to hide while
Mrs. Burton returned to her home with a
mind almost quiet.</p>

<p>The morning ended, however, and no
small boys appeared at the table. Mrs. Burton’
fears came back with increased strength
and she hurried off again to Mike and
implored him to go in search of the children.
The sight of an ugly looking tramp
or two by the way suggested kidnapping
to Mrs. Burton and brought tears to her
eyes. Even the doubting Mike, when he
learned that the children had eaten nothing
that day, grew visibly alarmed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
mounted one of his master’s horses in hot
haste.</p>

<p>“Where are you going first, Mike?” asked
Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“Dhivil a bit do I know!” exclaimed Mike;
“but I’m goin’ to foind ’em, an’ may the
blessed saints go with me!”</p>

<p>Away galloped Mike, and Mrs. Burton,
fearing that the alarm might reach the boys’
mother, hurried home, started the cook on
one road, the chambermaid on another, and
herself on a third, while Mike sought the
candystore, the schoolhouse, sundry bridges
over brooks, and the various other places that
boys delight in. Mrs. Burton’s own course
was along a road leading up the rugged,
heavily wooded hill called by courtesy a
mountain, but she paused so many times, to
call, to listen, to step considerably out of her
way to see if dimly descried figures were not
those of her nephews, and to discover that
what seemed in the forest to be boyish figures
were only stumps or bushes, that she
spent at least two hours upon the road,
which doubled many times upon itself. Suddenly
she saw in the road beyond her a familiar
figure dragging a large green bough.</p>

<p>“Budge!” she screamed and ran toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
him. The little figure turned its head, and
Mrs. Burton was shocked to see a haggard
face, whose whiteness intensified the starting
eyes, pink, distended nostrils, and thin,
drawn lips of her nephew. And upon the
bough, holding to one of the upper sprigs
tightly with one hand, while with the other
he clutched something green and crumpled,
lay Toddie, dust-encrusted from head to
foot.</p>

<p>“Oh! what has happened?” Mrs. Burton
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Toddie raised his head and explained.</p>

<p>“Izhe a shotted soldier bein’ tookted to
where de shooters can’t catch me, like sometimes
dey used to be in de war.”</p>

<p>Budge dropped in the road and cried.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it?” cried Mrs. Burton,
kneeling beside Toddie, and taking him in
her arms. And Toddie replied:</p>

<p>“Ow!”</p>

<p>“Budge, dear,” exclaimed Mrs. Burton,
releasing Toddie, and hurrying to his brother,
“what has happened? Do tell me!”</p>

<p>Budge opened his eyes and mouth reluctantly,
and replied with a thin voice:</p>

<p>“Wait till I get alive again, an’ I’ll tell
you. I haven’t got many words inside of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
me now; they’re all dropped out, I’m so
tired, and, oh&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p322.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“I’ZHE A SHOTTED SOLDIER”</div>
</div>

<p>Budge closed his eyes again. Mrs. Burton
picked him up tenderly, sat upon a large stone,
rocked back and forth, kissed him repeatedly,
cried over him, while Toddie turned upon his
stomach, surveyed the scene with apparent
satisfaction, and said:</p>

<p>“Say, Aunt Alish, it’s djolly to be a shotted
soldier.”</p>

<p>Budge slowly recovered, put his arm
around his aunt tightly, and said:</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Alice, ’twas awful!”</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it, dear, when you feel
well enough. Where have you been all day?
Aunty’s heart has been almost broken about
you.”</p>

<p>“Why, you see, we wanted to do something
nice for you, ’fore we went home to
stay, ’cause you’ve been so nice to us. Why,
when we talked about it, we couldn’t think
of a single unpleasant thing you’d done to
us&mdash;though I’m sure you done a lot. Anyhow,
we couldn’t ’member any.”</p>

<p>“’Cept sayin’ ‘Don’t!’s lotzh of timesh,”
said Toddie.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Budge, “Tod thought ’bout
that, but we made up our minds perhaps we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
needed that said to us. An’ we couldn’t
think of anything nicer than to get you some
wild flowers. Ev’rybody’s got tame flowers,
you know, so we thought wild ones would be
nicer. An’ we thought we could get ’em
’fore breakbux if we’d hurry, so off we came
right up to the foot of the mountains, but
there wasn’t any. I guess they wasn’t
awake yet, or else they’d gone to sleep.
Then we didn’t know what to do.”</p>

<p>“’Cept get you some bych [birch] bark,”
said Toddie.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Budge; “but birch bark is to
eat, an’ not to look at; an’ we wanted to give
you somethin’ you could see, an’ remember
us a few days by.”</p>

<p>“An’ all of a sudden I said ’fynes!’
[ferns],” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Budge, “Tod said it first, but
I thought it the same second. An’ there’
lovely ferns up in the rocks. Don’t you
see?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton looked, and shuddered. The
cliff above her head was a hundred feet high,
jagged all over its front, yet from every
crevice exquisite ferns posed their peaceful
fronds before the cold gray of the rock.</p>

<p>“’Twasn’t here,” Budge continued.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
“’Twas ’way up around the corner, where
the rocks ain’t so high, but they’re harder to
climb. We climbed up here first.”</p>

<p>“You dreadful, darling children!” exclaimed
Mrs. Burton, giving Budge a squeeze
of extra severity. “To think of two little
children going up such a dreadful place!
Why, it makes me dizzy to see your Uncle
Harry do it.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t childrens, when we climb mountainsh!”
asserted Toddie; “we’zh mans
den.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Budge continued, “we got lots,
and throwed each one away ’cause we kept
seein’ nicer ones higher up. Say, Aunt Alice,
what’s the reason things higher up always
look extra nice?”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“Why is it, Toddie?” Mrs. Burton asked.</p>

<p>“’Cauzh deysh closer to hebben,” said
Toddie. “G’won, Budgie. I likes to hear
’bout it, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, at last we got to a place where the
rocks all stopped and some more began. An’
up on them was the loveliest ferns of all.”</p>

<p>“An’ I went up dat mountain fyst, I did,”
said Toddie.</p>

<p>“Yes, Tod did, the blessed little sassy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
rascal,” said Budge, blowing a kiss to his
brother. “I told him I didn’t believe that
any ferns was nicer than any others, but he
said, ‘Lord’ll make ’em so den, for Aunt
Alish.’s An’ up he went, just like a spider.”</p>

<p>“Went up fyst,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>“’Course you did,” said Budge. “’Cause I
didn’t go up at all. And Tod was pullin’ at a
big fern with his back to me, an’ the first
thing I knew there he was in the air layin’
down sideways on nothin’. Then he hollered.”</p>

<p>“’Cauzh I camed down bunk on whole
lotch of little rocks,” explained Toddie. “But
I didn’t lose the fyne&mdash;here tizh!” and Toddie
held up a badly crushed and wilted ball
of something that had once been a fern, seeing
which Mrs. Burton placed Budge on the
stone, hurried to Toddie, thrust the bruised
fern into her bosom, and kissed its captor
soundly.</p>

<p>“Hold me some more,” said Budge, “I
don’t feel very good yet.”</p>

<p>“Then what did you do?” asked Mrs. Burton,
resuming her position as nurse.</p>

<p>“Why, Tod went on hollerin’, an’ he
couldn’t walk, so I helped him down to the
road, an’ he couldn’t walk yet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Burton had turned again to Toddie,
and carefully examined his legs without finding
any broken bones.</p>

<p>“The hurt is in de bottom part of my leg
an’ de top part of my foot,” said Toddie, who
had turned his ankle.</p>

<p>“An’ he just hollered ‘mam-<i>ma</i>’s and ‘pa-<i>pa</i>,’
so sad,” continued Budge. “An’ ’twas
awful. An’ I looked up the road an’ there
wasn’t anybody, an’ down the front of the
mountain and there wasn’t anybody, an’ I
didn’t know what to do, ’cause ’twouldn’t do
to go ’way off home to tell, when a poor little
brother was feelin’ so dreadful bad. Then I
’membered how papa said he’d sometimes
seen shot soldiers carried away when there
wasn’t any wagons. So I pulled at the limb of
a tree to get the thing to drag him on.”</p>

<p>“Why, Budge!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton,
“you don’t mean to say you got that bough
all alone by yourself, do you?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, I guess not,” said Budge, hesitatingly.
“I pulled at one after another,
but not one of them would split, and then I
thought of somethin’ an’ kneeled right down
by the tree, an’ told the Lord all about it, an’
told Him I knew He didn’t want poor little
hurt Tod to lie there all day, an’ wouldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
He please help me break a limb to draw him
on? An’ when I got up off of my knees I
was as strong as forty thousand horses. I
don’t think I needed the Lord to help me a
bit then. An’ I just gave one pull at the
limb, an’ down it came kersplit, an’ I put Tod
on it, an’ dragged him. But I tell you it was
hard work!”</p>

<p>“’Twash fun, too,” said Toddie, “’cept
when it went where dere was little rocks in de
road, an’ dey came up an’ hitted de hurt
playsh.”</p>

<p>“I dragged it in the soft parts of the road,”
said Budge, “whenever I could, but sometimes
there wasn’t any soft place all across
the road. An’ things jumped inside of me&mdash;that
little heart-engine, you know, awfully.
I could only go about a dozen steps without
stoppin’ to rest. An’ then Tod stopped cryin’
an’ said he was hungry, an’ that reminded
me that I was hungry, too.”</p>

<p>“But we didn’t lose the fyne,” said Toddie.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton took the memento from her
breast and kissed it.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Budge, “you like it, don’t
you? All right, then. Tod an’ me don’t
care for bothers an’ hurts now, do we, Tod?”</p>

<p>“No, indeedy,” said Toddie. “Not when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
we can ride like shotted soldiers, an’ get
home to get breakbux an’ lunch togevver.”</p>

<p>“Neither of you shall have any more
trouble about getting home,” said Mrs. Burton.
“Just sit here quietly while I go and
send a carriage for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Budge. “That’ll be lovely;
won’t it, Tod? Ain’t you glad you got hurt?
But say? Aunt Alice, haven’t you got any
crackers in your pocket?”</p>

<p>“Why, no&mdash;certainly not!” exclaimed the
lady, temporarily losing her tenderness.</p>

<p>“Oh! I thought you might have. Papa
always does, when he goes out to look for us
when we stay away from home a good
while.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a horse’s hoofs were heard on the
road below.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if that was Mike,”
said Mrs. Burton. “He has been out on
horseback, looking for you.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if ’twas papa,” said
Budge. “He’s the funniest man for always
comin’ anywhere first when we need him
most.”</p>

<p>“An’ wif crackers,” Toddie added.</p>

<p>The clattering hoofs came nearer, though
slower, and, true to the children’s intuitions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
around the bend of the road came Tom Lawrence
on horseback, an old army haversack
and canteen slung over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Papa!” shouted both boys. “Hooray!”
Tom Lawrence waved his hat, and Toddie
shouted, “He’s got de crackers! I see de
bag!” The father reined up suddenly and
dismounted, Budge rushed to his arms, and
Toddie exclaimed,</p>

<p>“Papa, guesh it’s a long time since you’
seen a shotted soldier, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>Then Toddie was placed in the saddle, and
Budge behind him, and the precious haversack
was opened and found to contain sandwiches,
and both boys tried to drink out of
the canteen, and poured a great deal of water
into their bosoms, and Tom led the horse
carefully, and Mrs. Burton walked upon one
side, with a hand under Toddie’s lame leg to
keep the bruised ankle from touching the
saddle, and she did not swerve from the middle
of the dusty road, even when carriages full
of stylish acquaintances were met, and both
little heroes, like men of larger growth, forgot
at once that they had ever been heroic, and
they prattled as inconsequently as any couple
of silly children could, and the horse was led
by a roundabout road so that no one might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
see the party and apprise Mrs. Lawrence that
anything unusual had happened, and the
boys were heavily bribed to tell their mother
nothing until their father had explained, and
they were carried in, each in his father’
arms, to kiss their mamma; and when they
undressed and went to bed, the sister-baby
was, by special dispensation of the nurse, allowed
to lie between them for a few moments,
and the evening ceremonies were prolonged
by the combined arts of boys and parent, and
then Budge knelt and prayed:</p>

<p>“Dear Lord, we’re awful glad to get back
again, ’cause nobody can be like papa and
mamma to us, an’ I’m so thankful I don’t
know what to do for bein’ made so strong
when I wanted to break that limb off of the
tree, and bless dear Aunt Alice for findin’ us,
and bless poor uncle more, ’cause he tried to
find us, and was disappointed, and make
every little boy’s papa just like ours, to come
to ’em just when they need him, just like you.
Amen.”</p>

<p>And Toddie shut his eyes in bed, and said,</p>

<p>“Dee Lord, I went up de mountain fyst.
Don’t forget dat. Amen.”</p>

</div><div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p>There was a little family conclave at
the Lawrence house a fortnight later.
No deliberative meeting had been intended;
quite the contrary; for Mrs. Lawrence was on
that day to make her first appearance at the
dinner-table in a month, and Mrs. Burton and
her husband were invited to step in informally
on the occasion, and they had been glad
enough to do so although the boys, who had
been allowed to dine that night with the family
in honor of the occasion, conversed so volubly
that no other person at the table could
speak without interruption.</p>

<p>But there came an hour when the boys
could no longer prolong the usual preliminaries
of going to bed, although they kissed
their parents and visitors once as a matter of
course, a second time to be sure they had
done it, and a third time to assure themselves
that they had forgotten nobody. Then several
chats were interrupted by various juvenile
demands, pleas and questions from the
upper floor; but as, when Lawrence went in
person to answer the last one he found both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
boys sleeping soundly the families devoted
themselves to each other with the determination
of passing a pleasant evening. They
talked of what was going on in the world, and
much that might be going on but was not, the
blame being due to persons who did not think
as they did; they sang, played, quoted books,
talked pictures and bric-a-brac, and then Mrs.
Lawrence changed the entire course of conversation
by promising
to replace Mrs. Burton’
chair which the dog Terry had destroyed
by special arrangement with the boys.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">BOTH BOYS SLEEPING SOUNDLY</div>
</div>

<p>“You sha’n’t do anything of the sort!” said
Mrs. Burton. “Keep the dear little scamps
from playing such pranks on any one who
don’t happen to love them so well, and I’ll
forgive them.”</p>

<p>“You don’t imagine for a moment that
they knew what the result would be when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
they tied Terry to the chair, do you?” Mrs.
Lawrence asked.</p>

<p>“Never!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton, emphatically,
“but they did it, and it might
have happened somewhere else, with people
who didn’t love them so well, and what would
they have thought?”</p>

<p>“She means that strangers would have
imagined your boys a couple of little boors,
Nell,” said Mr. Burton to his sister.</p>

<p>“Strangers know nothing whatever about
other people’s children,” said Mrs. Lawrence
with dignity, “and they should therefore
have nothing to do with them and pass no
opinions upon them. No one estimates
children by what they are; they only judge
by the amount of trouble they make.”</p>

<p>“Now you’ve done it, Mistress Alice,” said
Mr. Burton to his wife. “It is better to meet
a she-bear that is robbed of her whelps than
a mother whose children are criticized by any
one but herself.”</p>

<p>“I’ve done it!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton.
“Who translated my quiet remark into something
offensive. Besides, you’ve misapplied
Scripture only to suggest things worse yet.
If I’m not mistaken, the proverb about the
she-bear and her whelps has something in it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
about a fool and his folly. Do you mean to
insinuate such insulting ideas about your sister
and her darlings?”</p>

<p>But no amount of badinage could make
Mrs. Lawrence forget that some implied advice
was secreted in her sister-in-law’s carefully
worded remark, so she continued,</p>

<p>“I’m extremely sorry they had to go to
you, but I couldn’t imagine what better to do.
I wish Tom could have staid at home all the
while to take care of them. I hope, if we
ever die, they may follow us at once. Nothing
is so dreadful as the idea of one’s children
being perpetually misunderstood by some
one else, and having their honest little hearts
hardened and warped just when they should
be cared for most patiently and tenderly.”</p>

<p>“Helen!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton, changing
her seat so as to take Mrs. Lawrence’
hand, “I’d die for your children at any time,
if it would do them any good.”</p>

<p>“I believe you, you dear girl,” said Mrs.
Lawrence, recovering her natural manner,
and not entirely unashamed of her outburst
of feeling, “but you don’t understand it all,
as you will some day. The children trouble
me worse than they ever did or can any one
else; but it isn’t their fault, and I know it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
and can endure it. No one else can. I am
sure I don’t know how to blame people who
are annoyed by juvenile pranks.”</p>

<p>“Then what’s to be done with youngsters
in general?” Mrs. Burton asked.</p>

<p>“They’re to be kept at home,” said Mrs.
Lawrence, “under the eye of father or
mother continually, until they are large
enough to trust; and the age at which they’re
to be trusted should not be determined by the
impatience of their parents, either.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be frightened, Allie,” said Tom.
“Helen had some of these notions before she
had any boys of her own to defend.”</p>

<p>“They’re certainly not the result of my
children’s happy experiences with the best
aunt and uncle that ever lived,” said Mrs.
Lawrence, caressing her adopted sister’
hand. “If you could hear the boys’s praises
of you both, you’d grow insufferably vain,
and imagine yourselves born to manage
orphan asylums.”</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton,
the immediate result of her utterance being
the partial withdrawal of Mrs. Lawrence’
hand. “There are only two children in the
family&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Three,” corrected Mrs. Lawrence promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span></p>

<p>“Oh, bless me, what have I said!” exclaimed
Mrs. Burton. “Well, there are only
three children in the family, and they are not
enough to found an asylum, while I feel utterly
unfitted to care for any one child that I
don’t know very well and love very dearly.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible that any one can learn so
much in so short a time?” exclaimed Tom
Lawrence. “Harry, my boy, you’re to be
congratulated.”</p>

<p>“Upon having educated me?” Mrs. Burton
asked.</p>

<p>“Upon the rare wisdom with which he selected
a wife, or, the special favor he found at
the court where matches are made,” Tom
explained.</p>

<p>“Harry didn’t select me at all,” said Mrs.
Burton. “Budge did it for him, so of course
the match was decreed in heaven. But may
I know of what my sudden acquisition of
knowledge consists? If there’s anything in
my experience with the boys that I am not
to feel humiliated about, I should be extremely
glad to know of it. I went into the
valley of humiliation within an hour of their
arrival, and since then I’ve scarcely been out
of it.”</p>

<p>“If it weren’t for being suspected of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
throwing moral deductions at people,” Tom
replied, “I would say that that same valley
of humiliation is very prolific of discoveries.
But, preaching aside, no one can manage
children without first loving them. Even a
heart full of love has to make room for a lot
of sorrow over blunders and failures.”</p>

<p>“I’ve learned that affection is absolutely
necessary,” said Mrs. Burton, “but I confess
that I don’t see clearly that love requires that
one should be trampled upon, wheedled,
made of no account and without authority in
one’s own house, submit to anything, in
fact&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now you’ve done it again,” whispered
Mr. Burton to his wife, as Helen Lawrence’
cheek began to flush, and that maternal
divinity replied:</p>

<p>“Does the parent of all of us resign his
authority when he humors us in our childish
ways because we can’t comprehend any
greater ones? Every concession is followed
by growth on the part of his children, if they
are honest; when they are not, it seems to
me that the concessions aren’t made. But
my children are honest.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton’s lips were parting, seeing
which her husband whispered,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span></p>

<p>“Don’t!”</p>

<p>There was a moment or two of silence; then
Mrs. Burton asked:</p>

<p>“How are people to know when they’re not
being imposed upon by children? You can’t
apply to the funny little beings the rules that
explain the ways of grown people.”</p>

<p>“Is it the most dreadful thing in the world
to be imposed upon by a child?” asked Tom.
“We never impose upon them, do we? We
never give them unfair answers, arbitrary
commands, unkind restrictions, simply to
save ourselves a little extra labor or
thought?”</p>

<p>“Tom!” Mrs. Burton exclaimed; “I don’t
do anything of the sort, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“Why will you display so touchy a conscience,
then?” whispered her husband. “If
you continue to put up your defense the
instant Tom launches a criticism, he’ll begin
to suspect you of dreadful cruelty to the
boys.”</p>

<p>“Not I,” laughed Tom.</p>

<p>“She had you to reform, for half a year
before the boys visited her,” said Helen,
“and you still live.”</p>

<p>“But, Tom, seriously now, you don’t mean
to have me infer that children shouldn’t be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
made to mind, and be prevented from doing
things that can bother their elders?” asked
Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“Certainly they should have to obey,”
said Tom, “but I’d rather they wouldn’t, if
at the same time they must learn, as in general
they do, that obedience is imposed more
for the benefit of their elders than themselves.”</p>

<p>“I was always taught to obey,” said Mrs.
Burton, with the not unusual though always
unconscious peculiarity of supposing the recital
of personal experience to be a sufficient
argument and precedent.</p>

<p>“Do you find the habit still strong in her,
Harry?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“<i>Do</i> I!” exclaimed Harry, with a mock
tragic air, “’could I the horrors of my prison
house unfold,’s you would see that the obedient
member of the Burton family never appears
in gowns.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” said Mrs. Burton. “Didn’t
he promise to be mine, and shall I neglect my
responsibilities? I obeyed my parents.”</p>

<p>“And never doubted that their orders were
wise, beneficent, and necessary, of course?”
asked Lawrence.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p340.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE OBEDIENT MEMBER OF THE BURTON FAMILY</div>
</div>

<p>“Tom, Tom!” said Helen, warningly; “if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
you don’t want Alice to abuse other people’s
children be careful what you say about other
children’s parents. Don’t play grand inquisitor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not at all,” said Tom, hastily. “But
I should like to borrow woman’ curiosity for
a while, and have it gratified in this particular
case.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I always admitted the
wisdom of my parents’s commands,” said Mrs.
Burton; “but how could I? I was only a child.”</p>

<p>“You rendered unquestioning obedience
in spirit as well as in act, when you became
a young lady, then?” pursued Tom.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t. There!” Mrs. Burton exclaimed;
“but what return can a child make
for parental care and suffering, except to at
least seem to be a model of compliance with
its parents’s desires?”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Harry. “And what
can a husband, who knows that his own way
is best, do to recompense wifely companionship
but meekly do as his wife wants him to,
no matter how incorrect her ideas?”</p>

<p>“He can listen to reason and not be a conceited
goose,” said Mrs. Burton; “and he
can refrain from impeding the flow of brotherly
instruction.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span></p>

<p>“Tom shall say whatever he likes,” said
Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lawrence’s smile showed that she
would be satisfied with the result, and her
husband continued:</p>

<p>“Children&mdash;ninety-nine one-hundredths of
those I’ve seen, at least, are treated as necessary
nuisances by their parents. The good
fathers and mothers would be horrified to
realize this truth, and when it accidentally
presents itself, as it frequently does to any
with heart and head, its appearance is so unpleasing
and perplexing that they promptly
take refuge in tradition. Weren’t they
brought up in the same way? To be sure,
it’s the application of the same rule that has
always made the ex-slave the cruelest of
overseers, and the ex-servant the worst of
masters; but such comparisons are odious to
one’s pride, and what chance has self-respect
when pride steps down before it?”</p>

<p>“Poor human nature!” sighed Harry.
“You’ll get to Adam’s fall pretty soon,
won’t you, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Don’t fear,” laughed Mr. Lawrence. “It’
the falling of later people that troubles me&mdash;that,
and their willingness to stay down
when they’ve tumbled and the calmness with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
which they can lie quiet and crush poor little
children who aren’t responsible for being under
them. Adam knew enough to wish himself
back in his honorable position, but most
parents have had no lofty position to which
they could look longingly back, and but few
of them can remember any such place having
been in the possession of any member of their
respective families.”</p>

<p>“But what is to be done, even if any one
wishes to live up to your ideal standard as a
guardian of children?” Mrs. Burton asked.
“Submit to any and every imposition; allow
every misdeed to go unpunished; be the ruled
instead of the ruler?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Tom, “it’s something far
harder than that. It’s to live for the children
instead of one’s self.”</p>

<p>“And have all your nice times spoiled and
your plans upset?”</p>

<p>“Yes, unless they’re really of more value
than human life and human character,” Tom
replied. “You indicated the proper starting
point in your last remark; if you’ll study that
for yourself, you’ll learn a great deal more
than I can tell you, and learn it more pleasantly
too.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to study,” said Mrs. Burton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
“when I can get my information at second-hand.”</p>

<p>“Go on, Tom,” said Mr. Burton, “Continue
to appear in your character of the
‘Parental Encyclopædist’; we’ll try to stop
one ear so that what goes in at the other
shall not be lost.”</p>

<p>“I only want to say that the plans and
good times spoiled by the children are what
ruin every promising generation. The child
should be taught, but instead of that he is
only restrained. He should be encouraged
to learn the meaning and the essence of
whatever of the inevitable is forced upon him
from year to year; but he soon learns that
children’s questions are as unwelcome as tax-collectors
or lightning-rod men. It’s astonishing
how few hints are necessary to give a
child the habit of retiring into himself, and
from there to such company as he can find to
tolerate him.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t fear for your boys, Tom,”
said Mr. Burton. “I’d pay handsomely for
the discovery of a single question which
they have ever wanted to ask but refrained
from putting.”</p>

<p>“And what myriads of them they can
ask&mdash;not that there’s anything wrong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
about it, the little darlings,” Mrs. Burton
added.</p>

<p>“I am glad of it,” said Tom; “but I hope
they’ll never again have to go to any one but
their mother and me for information.”</p>

<p>“Tom, there you go again!” said Mrs.
Burton. “Please don’t believe I ever refused
them an answer or answered unkindly.”</p>

<p>“Certainly you haven’t,” said Tom. “Excuse
a stale quotation&mdash;’the exception proves
the rule.’s I’ve really been nervously anxious
about the soundness of this rule, until you
were brought into the family, for I never
knew another exception.”</p>

<p>“May I humbly suggest that a certain
brother-in-law existed before the boys had
an Aunt Alice?” asked Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Tom; “but he was too well
rewarded, for the little he did, to be worthy of
consideration.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton inclined her head in acknowledgment
of her brother-in-law’s compliment,
and asked:</p>

<p>“Do you think all children’s questions are
put with any distinct intention? Don’t you
imagine that they ask a great many because
they don’t know what else to do, or because
they want to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span></p>

<p>“To talk against time, she means, Tom,”
said Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“Very likely. But the answers are what
are of consequence, no matter what the motive
of the questions may be.”</p>

<p>“What an idea!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton;
“really, Tom, aren’t you afraid you’re losing
yourself?”</p>

<p>“I really hadn’t noticed it,” said Tom;
“but perhaps I may be able to explain myself
more clearly. You go to church?”</p>

<p>“Regularly&mdash;every Sunday,” responded
Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“And always with the most reverent feelings,
of course. You never find your mind
full of idle questionings, or mere curious wondering,
or even a perfect blank, or a circle
upon which your thoughts chase themselves
around to their starting place without aim
or motive?”</p>

<p>“How well you know the ways of the hum-drum
mind, Tom,” said Mrs. Burton. “You
didn’t learn them from your personal experience,
of course?”</p>

<p>“I wish I hadn’t! But supposing you at
some few times in your life have gone into
the sanctuary in such frames of mind, did
you never have them changed by what you’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
heard? Did you never have the very common
experience of learning that it is at these very
moments of weakness, indecision, blankness,
childishness, or whatever you may please to
call it, the mind becomes peculiarly retentive
of whatever of real value happens to strike it?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton reflected, and by silence signified
her assent, but she was not fully satisfied
with the explanation, for she asked,</p>

<p>“Do you think, then, that all the ways of
children are just as they should be?&mdash;that
they never ask questions from any but
heaven-ordained motives?&mdash;that they are
utterly devoid of petty guile?”</p>

<p>“They’re human, I believe,” said Mr. Lawrence,
“and full of human weaknesses, but
any other human beings&mdash;present company
excepted, of course&mdash;should know by experience
how little malice there is in the most
annoying of people. Certainly children do
copy the faults of their elders, and&mdash;oh, woe
is me! inherit the failings of their ancestors,
but it is astonishing how few they seem to
have when the observer will forget himself
and honestly devote himself to their good. I
confess it does need the wisdom of Solomon
to discover when they are honest and when
they’re inclined to be tricky.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span></p>

<p>“And can you inform us where the wisdom
of Solomon is to be procured for the purpose?”
asked Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>“From the source at which Solomon obtained
it, I suppose,” Tom replied; “from an
honest, unselfish mind. But it is so much
easier to trust to selfishness and its twin
demon suspicion, that nothing but a pitying
Providence saves most children from reform
schools and penitentiaries.”</p>

<p>“But the superiority of adults&mdash;their right
to demand implicit, unquestioning obedience&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is the most vicious, debasing tyranny
that the world is cursed by, “Tom exclaimed
with startling emphasis.” It gave the old
Romans power of life and death over their
children. It cast some of the vilest blots
upon the pages of Holy Writ. Nowadays it is
worse, for then it worked its principal mischief
upon the body, but nowadays ‘I say unto you
fear not them that kill the body, but’&mdash;excuse
a free rendering&mdash;fear them who cast
both soul and body into hell. You’re orthodox,
I believe.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton shuddered, but her belief in
the rights of adults, which she had inherited
from a line of ancestors reaching back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
Adam or protoplasm, was more powerful
than her horror, and the latter was quickly
overcome by the former.</p>

<p>“Then adults have no rights that children
are bound to respect?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; the right of undoing the failures of
their own education and doing it for the benefit
of beings who are not responsible for their
own existence. Can you imagine a greater
crime than calling a soul into existence without
its own desire and volition, and then
making it your slave instead of making yourself
its friend?”</p>

<p>“Why, Tom, you’re perfectly dreadful,”
exclaimed Mrs. Burton.” One would suppose
that parents were a lot of pre-ordained
monsters!”</p>

<p>“They’re worse,” said Tom; “they’re unthinking
people with a lot of self-satisfaction,
and a reputation for correctness of life.
Malicious people are easily caught and kept
out of mischief by the law. The respectable,
unintentional evil-doers are those who make
most of the trouble and suffering in the world.”</p>

<p>“And you propose to go through life dying
deaths daily for the sake of those children,”
said Alice, “rather than make them what you
would like them to be?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>

<p>“No,” said Tom, “I propose to live a new
life daily, and learn what life should be, for
the sake of making them what I would like
them to be; for I don’t value them so much
as conveniences and playthings, as for what
they may be to themselves, and to a world
that sorely needs good men.”</p>

<p>“And women,” added Mrs. Lawrence. “I
do believe you’ve forgotten the baby, you
heartless wretch!”</p>

<p>“I accept the amendment,” said Tom,
“but the world has already more good women
than it begins to appreciate.”</p>

<p>“Bless me! what a quantity of governing
that poor sister-baby will get!” said Mrs.
Burton. “But, of course, you don’t call it
governing; you’ll denominate it self-immolation;
you’ll lose your remaining hair, and
grow ten years older in the first year of its
life.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder,” said Tom, with an
expression of countenance which banished
the smiles occasioned by his sister-in-law’
remark.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton; “is
there any more?”</p>

<p>“Only this&mdash;it’s positively the last&mdash;’and,
finally, we then that are strong ought to bear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
the infirmities of the weak, and not to please
ourselves.’s Again I would remark, that I
believe you’re orthodox?”</p>

<p>The Burtons looked very sober for a moment,
when suddenly there came through the
air the cry&mdash;</p>

<p>“Pa-<i>pa</i>!”</p>

<p>Tom sprang to his feet; Helen looked anxious,
and the Burtons smiled quietly at each
other. The cry was repeated, and louder,
and as Tom opened the door a little figure in
white appeared.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">MAKING THEM WHAT I WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE</div>
</div>

<p>“I can’t get to sleep,” said Budge, shielding
his eyes a moment from the light. “I
ain’t seen you for so long that I’e got to sit
in your lap till some sleep will come to me.”</p>

<p>“Come to auntie, Budge,” said Mrs. Burton.
“Poor papa is real tired; you can’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
imagine the terrible work he’s been at for an
hour.”</p>

<p>“Papa says it rests him to rest me,” said
Budge, clasping his father tightly.</p>

<p>The Burtons looked on with quiet amusement,
until there arose another cry in the hall
of&mdash;</p>

<p>“Papa! Ow! pa-pa!”</p>

<p>Again Tom hurried to the door, this time
with Budge clinging around his neck. As the
door opened, Toddie crept in on his hands and
knees, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“De old bed wazh all empty, only ’cept me,
an’ I kwawled down de stepsh ’cauzh I didn’t
want to be loneshome no more. And Ize all
empty too, and I wantsh somefin’ to eat.”</p>

<p>Helen went to the dining-room closet and
brought in a piece of light cake.</p>

<p>“There goes all my good instructions,”
groaned Mrs. Burton. “To think of the industry
with which I have always labored to
teach those children that it’s injurious to eat
between meals, and, worse yet, to eat cake!”</p>

<p>“And to think of how you always ended by
letting the children have their own way!”
added Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>“Eating between meals is the least of two
evils,” said Tom. “When a small boy is kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
in bed with a sprained ankle, and on a short
allowance of food&mdash;&mdash; Oh, dear! I see my
subject nosing around again, Alice. Do you
know that most of the wickednesses of children
come from the lack of proper attention
to their physical condition?”</p>

<p>“Save me! Pity me!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton.
“I’m convinced already that I don’t
know a single thing about children, and I’ll
know still less if I take another lesson to-day.”</p>

<p>“Izh you takin’ lessons, Aunt Alish?”
asked Toddie, who had caught a fragment of
the conversation. “What book is you lynin’
fwom?”</p>

<p>“A primer,” replied Mrs. Burton; “the
very smallest, most insignificant of A B C
books.”</p>

<p>“Why, can’t you read?” asked Budge.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” sighed Mrs. Burton. “’But
whether there be knowledge it shall vanish
away.’”</p>

<p>“’But love never faileth,’” responded Mr.
Lawrence.</p>

<p>“If you want to learn anythin’,” said
Budge, “just you ask my papa. He’ll make
you know all about it, no matter how awful
stupid you are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span></p>

<p>“Many thanks for the advice&mdash;and the insinuations,”
said Mrs. Burton. “I feel as
if the latter were specially pertinent, from
the daze my head is in. I never knew before
how necessary it was to be nobody in order
to be somebody.”</p>

<p>The boys took possession of their father,
one on each knee, and Tom rocked with
them and chatted in a low tone to them, and
hummed a tune, and finally broke into a song,
and as it happened to be one of the variety
known as “roaring,” his brother-in-law joined
him, and the air recalled old friends and old
associations, and both voices grew louder,
and the ladies caught the air and increased
its volume with their own voices, when suddenly
a very shrill thin voice was heard
above their heads, and Mrs. Lawrence
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Sh&mdash;h&mdash;h! The baby is awake.”</p>

<p>Subsequent sounds indicated beyond doubt
that Mrs. Lawrence was correct in her supposition,
and she started instinctively for the
upper floor, but found herself arrested by her
husband’s arm and anxious face, while Mrs.
Burton exclaimed,</p>

<p>“Oh, bring it down here! Please, do!”</p>

<p>The nurse was summoned, and soon ap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>peared
with a wee bundle of flannel, linen,
pink face and fingers.</p>

<p>“Give her to me!” exclaimed Mrs. Burton,
rising to take the baby, but the baby exclaimed
“Ah!” and its mother snatched it.
Then the baby did its best to hide in its
mother’s bosom, and its mother did her best
to help it, and by the merest chance a rosy
little foot escaped from its covering, seeing
which Mrs. Burton hurriedly moved her
chair and covered the foot with both her
hands; though it would have been equally
convenient and far less laborious to have
tucked the foot back among its habitual
wrappings. Then the boys had to be moved
nearer the baby, so that they could touch it,
and try to persuade it to coo; and Harry Burton
found himself sitting so far from any one
else that he drew his chair closer to the group,
just to be sociable; and the Lawrences grew
gradually to look very happy, while the Burtons
grew more and more solemn, and at last
the hands of Mr. and Mrs. Burton met
under the superabundant wraps of the baby,
and then their eyes met, and the lady’s eyes
were full of tears and her husband’s full of
tenderness, and Budge, who had taken in the
whole scene, broke the silence by remarking;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span></p>

<p>“Why, Aunt Alice, what are you crying
for?”</p>

<p>Then every one looked up and looked
awkward, until Mrs. Lawrence leaned over
the baby and kissed her sister-in-law, noticing
which the two men rose abruptly, although
Tom Lawrence found occasion to indulge in
the ceremony of taking Harry Burton by the
hand. Then the baby yielded to her aunt’
solicitations, and changed her resting-place
for a few moments, and the gentlemen were
informed that if they wanted to smoke they
would have to do it in the dining-room, for
Mrs. Lawrence was not yet able to bear it.
Then the gentlemen adjourned and stared
at each other as awkwardly over their cigars
as if they had never met before, and the ladies
chatted as confidentially as if they were twin
sisters that had never been separated, and
the boys were carried back to bed, one by
each gentleman, and they were re-kissed
good night, and their father and uncle were
departing when Toddie remarked,</p>

<p>“Papa, mamma hazhn’t gived our sister-baby
to Aunt Alish to keep, hazh she?”</p>

<p>“No, old chap,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“I don’t want anybody to have that sister-baby
but us,” said Budge; “but if anybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
had to, Aunt Alice would be the person. Do
you know, I believe she was prayin’ to it, she
looked so funny.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p357.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A LITTLE VISITOR AT THE BURTONS’</div>
</div>

<p>The gentlemen winked at each other, and
again Tom Lawrence took the hand of his
brother-in-law. Several months later, the
apprehensions of the boys were quieted by
the appearance of a little visitor at the Burtons’,
who acted as if she had come to stay,
and who in the course of years cured Mrs.
Burton of every assumption of the ability of
relatives to manage “Other People’s Children.”</p>

Beverly on the cover.</p>

<p>“The most fascinating, engrossing and picturesque of the season’
novels.”&mdash;<i>Boston Herald.</i> “’Beverly’s is altogether charming&mdash;almost
living flesh and blood.”&mdash;<i>Louisville Times.</i> “Better than
‘Graustark’.”&mdash;<i>Mail and Express.</i> “A sequel quite as impossible
as ‘Graustark’s and quite as entertaining.”&mdash;<i>Bookman.</i> “A charming
love story well told.”&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript</i>.</p>

<p class="hang">HALF A ROGUE. By Harold MacGrath. With illustrations
and inlay cover picture by Harrison Fisher.</p>

<p>“Here are dexterity of plot, glancing play at witty talk, characters
really human and humanly real, spirit and gladness, freshness and
quick movement. ‘Half a Rogue’s is as brisk as a horseback ride on
a glorious morning. It is as varied as an April day. It is as charming
as two most charming girls can make it. Love and honor and success
and all the great things worth fighting for and living for the involved
in ‘Half a Rogue.’”&mdash;<i>Phila. Press.</i></p>

<p class="hang">THE GIRL FROM TIM’S PLACE. By Charles Clark
Munn. With illustrations by Frank T. Merrill.</p>

<p>“Figuring in the pages of this story there are several strong characters.
Typical New England folk and an especially sturdy one, old
Cy Walker, through whose instrumentality Chip comes to happiness
and fortune. There is a chain of comedy, tragedy, pathos and love,
which makes a dramatic story.”&mdash;<i>Boston Herald.</i></p>

<p class="hang">THE LION AND THE MOUSE. A story of American Life.
By Charles Klein, and Arthur Hornblow. With illustrations
by Stuart Travis, and Scenes from the Play.</p>

<p>The novel duplicated the success of the play; in fact the book is
greater than the play. A portentous clash of dominant personalities
that form the essence of the play are necessarily touched upon but
briefly in the short space of four acts. All this is narrated in the
novel with a wealth of fascinating and absorbing detail, making it one
of the most powerfully written and exciting works of fiction given to
the world in years.</p>

With illustrations by John Rae, and colored inlay cover.</p>

<p>The following, taken from story, will best describe the heroine:
A TOAST: “To the bravest comrade in misfortune, the sweetest
companion in peace and at all times the most courageous of women.”&mdash;<i>Barbara
Winslow.</i> “A romantic story, buoyant, eventful, and in
matters of love exactly what the heart could desire.”&mdash;<i>New York Sun.</i></p>

<p class="hang">SUSAN. By Ernest Oldmeadow. With a color frontispiece
by Frank Haviland. Medalion in color on front cover.</p>

<p>Lord Ruddington falls helplessly in love with Miss Langley, whom
he sees in one of her walks accompanied by her maid, Susan.
Through a misapprehension of personalities his lordship addresses
a love missive to the maid. Susan accepts in perfect good faith,
and an epistolary love-making goes on till they are disillusioned. It
naturally makes a droll and delightful little comedy; and is a story
that is particularly clever in the telling.</p>

With illustrations by C. D. Williams.</p>

<p>“The book is a treasure.”&mdash;<i>Chicago Daily News.</i> “Bright,

of the best stories of life in a girl’s college that has ever been written.”&mdash;<i>N.
Y. Press.</i> “To any woman who has enjoyed the pleasures

and to those who have not been to college the wit, lightness,
and charm of Patty are sure to be no less delightful.”&mdash;<i>Public Opinion.</i></p>

With illustrations by Clarence F. Underwood.</p>

<p>“You can’t drop it till you have turned the last page.”&mdash;<i>Cleveland

takes one’s breath away. The boldness of its denouement
is sublime.”&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript.</i> “The literary hit of a generation.
The best of it is the story deserves all its success. A masterly story.”&mdash;<i>St.
Louis Dispatch.</i> “The story is ingeniously told, and cleverly
constructed.”&mdash;<i>The Dial.</i></p>

a high sense of honor, too, and that causes complications. She is a
very human, lovable character, and love saves her.”&mdash;<i>N. Y. Times.</i></p>

<p class="hang">THE AFFAIR AT THE INN. By Kate Douglas Wiggin.
With illustrations by Martin Justice.</p>

<p>“As superlatively clever in the writing as it is entertaining in the
reading. It is actual comedy of the most artistic sort, and it is
handled with a freshness and originality that is unquestionably
novel.”&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript.</i> “A feast of humor and good cheer,
yet subtly pervaded by special shades of feeling, fancy, tenderness,
or whimsicality. A merry thing in prose.”&mdash;<i>St. Louis Democrat.</i></p>

<p class="hang">ROSE O’ THE RIVER. By Kate Douglas Wiggin. With
illustrations by George Wright.</p>

refreshing story, an ideal book to give a young girl.”&mdash;<i>Chicago

<p>The little “Mennonite Maid” who wanders through these pages
is something quite new in fiction. Tillie is hungry for books and
beauty and love; and she comes into her inheritance at the end.
“Tillie is faulty, sensitive, big-hearted, eminently human, and first,
last and always lovable. Her charm glows warmly, the story is well
handled, the characters skilfully developed.”&mdash;<i>The Book Buyer.</i></p>

With illustrations by Howard Chandler Christy.</p>

no other story has Mrs. Ward approached the brilliancy and vivacity

<p class="hang">THE BANKER AND THE BEAR. By Henry K. Webster.</p>

<p>“An exciting and absorbing story.”&mdash;<i>New York Times.</i> “Intensely
thrilling in parts, but an unusually good story all through. There
is a love affair of real charm and most novel surroundings, there is a
run on the bank which is almost worth a year’s growth, and there is
all manner of exhilarating men and deeds which should bring the
book into high and permanent favor.”&mdash;<i>Chicago Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>BIRD NEIGHBORS. An Introductory Acquaintance
with 150 Birds Commonly Found in the Woods,
Fields and Gardens About Our Homes. By Neltje
Blanchan. With an Introduction by John Burroughs,
and many plates of birds in natural colors. Large
Quarto, size 7¾ × 10⅜, Cloth. Formerly published
at $2.00. Our special price, $1.00.</p>

<p>As an aid to the elementary study of bird life nothing has ever been
published more satisfactory than this most successful of Nature
Books. This book makes the identification of our birds simple and
positive, even to the uninitiated, through certain unique features.
I. All the birds are grouped according to color, in the belief that a
bird’s coloring is the first and often the only characteristic noticed.
II. By another classification, the birds are grouped according to their
season. III. All the popular names by which a bird is known are
given both in the descriptions and the index. The colored plates
are the most beautiful and accurate ever given in a moderate-priced
and popular book. The most successful and widely sold Nature
Book yet published.</p>

<p>BIRDS THAT HUNT AND ARE HUNTED. Life
Histories of 170 Birds of Prey, Game Birds and Water-Fowls.
By Neltje Blanchan. With Introduction by
G. O. Shields (Coquina). 24 photographic illustrations
in color. Large Quarto, size 7¾ × 10⅜. Formerly
published at $2.00. Our special price, $1.00.</p>

<p>No work of its class has ever been issued that contains so much
valuable information, presented with such felicity and charm. The
colored plates are true to nature. By their aid alone any bird illustrated
may be readily identified. Sportsmen will especially relish
the twenty-four color plates which show the more important birds in
characteristic poses. They are probably the most valuable and
artistic pictures of the kind available to-day.</p>

<p>NATURE’S GARDEN. An Aid to Knowledge of
Our Wild Flowers and Their Insect Visitors. 24 colored
plates, and many other illustrations photographed
directly from nature. Text by Neltje Blanchan,
Large Quarto, size 7-3/4 × 10-3/8. Cloth. Formerly published
at $3.00 net. Our special price, $1.25.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Superb color portraits of many familiar flowers in
their living tints, and no less beautiful pictures in
black and white of others&mdash;each blossom photographed
directly from nature&mdash;form an unrivaled
series. By their aid alone the novice can name the
flowers met afield.</p>

<p>Intimate life-histories of over five hundred species
of wild flowers, written in untechnical, vivid language,
emphasize the marvelously interesting and
vital relationship existing between these flowers and
the special insect to which each is adapted.</p>

<p>The flowers are divided into five color groups, because
by this arrangement any one with no knowledge
of botany whatever can readily identify the
specimens met during a walk. The various popular
names by which each species is known, its preferred
dwelling-place, months of blooming and geographical
distribution follow its description. Lists of berry-bearing
and other plants most conspicuous after the
flowering season, of such as grow together in different
kinds of soil, and finally of family groups arranged
by that method of scientific classification
adopted by the International Botanical Congress
which has now superseded all others, combine to
make “Nature’s Garden” an indispensable guide.</p>

<p class="hang">THE SPIRIT OF THE SERVICE. By Edith Elmer
Wood. With illustrations by Rufus Zogbaum.</p>

<p>The standards and life of “the new navy” are breezily set forth
with a genuine ring impossible from the most gifted “outsider.”
“The story of the destruction of the ‘Maine,’s and of the Battle of
Manila, are very dramatic. The author is the daughter of one naval
officer and the wife of another. Naval folks will find much to interest
them in ‘The Spirit of the Service.’”&mdash;<i>The Book Buyer.</i></p>

<p class="hang">A SPECTRE OF POWER. By Charles Egbert Craddock.</p>

<p>Miss Murfree has pictured Tennessee mountains and the mountain
people in striking colors and with dramatic vividness, but goes back
to the time of the struggles of the French and English in the early
eighteenth century for possession of the Cherokee territory. The
story abounds in adventure, mystery, peril and suspense.</p>

<p class="hang">THE STORM CENTRE. By Charles Egbert Craddock.</p>

<p>A war story; but more of flirtation, love and courtship than of
fighting or history. The tale is thoroughly readable and takes its
readers again into golden Tennessee, into the atmosphere which has
distinguished all of Miss Murfree’s novels.</p>

<p class="hang">THE ADVENTURESS. By Coralie Stanton. With color
frontispiece by Harrison Fisher, and attractive inlay cover
in colors.</p>

<p>As a penalty for her crimes, her evil nature, her flint-like callousness,
her more than inhuman cruelty, her contempt for the laws of
God and man, she was condemned to bury her magnificent personality,
her transcendent beauty, her superhuman charms, in gilded
obscurity at a King’s left hand. A powerful story powerfully told.</p>

<p class="hang">THE GOLDEN GREYHOUND. A Novel by Dwight
Tilton. With illustrations by E. Pollak.</p>

<p>A thoroughly good story that keeps you guessing to the very end,
and never attempts to instruct or reform you. It is a strictly up-to-date
story of love and mystery with wireless telegraphy and all the
modern improvements. The events nearly all take place on a big
Atlantic liner and the romance of the deep is skilfully made to serve
as a setting for the romance, old as mankind, yet always new, involving
our hero.</p>

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
